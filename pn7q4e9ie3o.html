<div>Lethal effects result in  death after a certain period of exposure to a specific concentration. However,  a given stressor may have a detrimental effect without causing mortality. This  is termed a sublethal effect. Sublethal effects are wide ranging and include  reduced growth and reproduction, behavioral anomalies, and altered metabolic  rates. Respiration rates of mussels can be altered by metals and  nitrogenous wastes&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{wang_metal_2005,zhao_environmental_2014}</cite>. This in turn can strongly alter energetic budgets  of organisms&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{mueller_regulation_2011}</cite>, and lead to strong effects on scope for  growth. Jim Stoeckel is currently conducting  research to assess how thermal and chemical stressors affect metabolic patterns  of mussels. In the proposed study, we will compare effects of  treated and untreated stormwater on mussels  using a combination of  lethal effect assays focusing on mortality, and sublethal assays focusing on respiration  rates as a sensitive indicator of sublethal metabolic stress that can lead to  changes in an individualâ€™s scope for growth. <b>We have found no research on the response of Alabama native  mussels to treated or untreated stormwater.</b></div>

PLSR can be used to analyze spectra measurements from hundreds of wavelengths and to reduce them to a smaller number of components. The number of components necessary is selected by minimizing the root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP). <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Etheridge_2014}</cite>&nbsp;used PLSR to determine nutrient, dissolved organic carbon, and total suspended solids concentrations in brackish water. <b>NEED TO ADD MORE REFERENCES HERE.</b></div><div>A preliminary data set of PLSR applied to copper and zinc nitrate at different concentrations.

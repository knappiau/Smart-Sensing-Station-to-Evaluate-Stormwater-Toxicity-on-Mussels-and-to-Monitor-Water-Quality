<div>These data will allow us to 1) characterize suites of contaminants that trigger BEWS alarms by mussels, 2) assess the bioretention cell for contaminant reduction below thresholds that trigger BEWS alarms, and 3) link contaminant concentrations and animal behavior to electrochemical properties of the water sample.</div><div>The gaping behavior will be monitored with electromagnetic sensors whose data will be collected together with the water quality data by a micocontroller unit (MCU). Measurements will be transmitted in real-time either via WI-FI or cellular network to a central server. After a pilot phase we plan to implement several of these Smart Sensing Stations across the campus. That way we will be able to characterize stromwater from different locations, assess stormwater toxicity from different locations, and monitor water quality at different locations within the watershed. We will create a project website where data and analysis will be posted.</div>

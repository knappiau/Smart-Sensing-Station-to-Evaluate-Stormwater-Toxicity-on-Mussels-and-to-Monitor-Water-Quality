Measurements will be transmitted in real-time either via WI-FI or cellular network to a central server. After a pilot phase we plan to implement several of these Smart Sensing Stations across the campus. That way we will be able to characterize stromwater from different locations, assess stormwater toxicity from different locations, and monitor water quality at different locations within the watershed. We will create a project website where data and analysis will be posted.</div>

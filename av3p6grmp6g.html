<div>Biological Early Warning Systems</div><div>Biological early warning systems (BEWSs) provide behavioral and  physiological response alerts when contaminants pulse down waterways in concentrations  that are likely to have negative effects on aquatic communities&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{bae2014biological}</cite>. Behavioral responses of bivalves can serve as a valuable early warning  system. Mussels must keep their shells open to obtain food and oxygen from the  surrounding waters. However, they respond to toxicants and close their shells.  Electromagnetic sensors attached to each valve are used to monitor gaping and  closing behavior and set off alarms when behavior indicates the presence of  stressful toxicants in the water&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{manley_behavioural_1979,kramer_valve_1989,gnyubkin_early_2009}</cite>. Systems such as the Mosselmonitor (<a href="http://www.mosselmonitor.nl" target="_blank">www.mosselmonitor.nl</a>; <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citealt{kramer_valve_1989}</cite> ) and the Dreissena Monitor (Envicontrol Köln Germany; <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citealt{borcherding_dreissena-monitor_1994}</cite>) have been used to monitor fresh and saltwater environments  in Europe.</div><div> Lethal effects result in  death after a certain period of exposure to a specific concentration. However,  a given stressor may have a detrimental effect without causing mortality. This  is termed a sublethal effect. Sublethal effects are wide ranging and include  reduced growth and reproduction, behavioral anomalies, and altered metabolic  rates. Respiration rates of mussels and crayfish can be altered by metals and  nitrogenous wastes&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{meade_toxicity_1995,rowe_metabolic_2001,wang_metal_2005}</cite>. This in turn can strongly alter energetic budgets  of organisms&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{mueller_regulation_2011}</cite>, and lead to strong effects on scope for  growth . Jim Stoeckel is currently conducting  research to assess how thermal and chemical stressors affect metabolic patterns  of mussels. In the proposed study, we will compare effects of  treated and untreated stormwater on mussels  using a combination of  lethal effect assays focusing on mortality, and sublethal assays focusing on respiration  rates as a sensitive indicator of sublethal metabolic stress that can lead to  changes in an individual’s scope for growth. <b>We have found no research on the response of Alabama native  mussels to treated or untreated stormwater.</b></div><h2 data-label="145928" class="ltx_title_subsection"></h2><h2 data-label="145928" class="ltx_title_subsection"></h2><h2 data-label="145928" class="ltx_title_subsection"><b>Motivation, Goals, and Objectives</b></h2><div>Today, a vast number of water quality parameters are sampled from surface waters and stormwater catchments. However, these samples are taken at discrete time intervals and are usually not able to capture pulses or plumes of contaminants. Continuous monitoring is necessary to capture and understand spatial and temporal contaminant distributions. Although water quality samples are taken to test the toxicity of a water body, oftentimes the water quality data does not relate to actual toxicity of individual species or toxicity data is available for certain species but only lethal effects were studied.</div><div>The goals of our research is to understand stormwater toxicity on aquatic organisms, to identify how stormwater treated with bioretention media affects stormwater toxicity, to design a toxicity sensor that measures toxicity, and to create a network of sensor stations that acquire water quality data in high temporal and spatial resolution.</div><div>The objectives of this project are to:
</div><ol><li>Determine lethal and sublethal effects of treated and un-treated stormwater on Alabama mussels and evaluate whether storm water treated with the Alabama bioretention soil mix is less toxic to mussels than untreated stormwater.</li><li>Develop a biological early warning system (BEWS) based on behavioral and physiological responses of mussels to stormwater.</li><li>&nbsp;Develop a toxicity sensor.</li><li>Combine everything into a Smart Sensing Station that communicates wirelessly.&nbsp;</li></ol><h1 data-label="213259" class="ltx_title_section">Approach</h1><h2 data-label="161369" class="ltx_title_subsection">Overview</h2><div>To meat our objectives we will build a Smart Sensing Station that will host mussels and different sensors, such as a toxicity sensor (to be developed in this project), and of the shelf sensors for water depth, temperature, and turbidity. A first prototype of the smart sensing station will be connected to a stormwater flume on the campus of Auburn University (Fig.&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{894273}</span>). Stormwater from this flume was found to be toxic to&nbsp;<i>Daphnia pulex&nbsp;</i>if untreated&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Kuntz:2017}</cite>. The stormwater flow will be separated and one half will be treated with the Alabama bioretention mix and the other half will remain untreated. Both flows, treated and untreated, will then be routed in separate mussel containing chambers (Symbols A and B in Fig.&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{894273}</span>). Stream water will be directed to a third chamber&nbsp;(Symbol C in Fig.&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{894273}</span>) to monitor mussel behavior when exposed to stream water only and to capture eventual contaminant plumes that are in the stream already. During dry periods, stream water will be directed to all 3 chambers (A-C) to sustain the mussels.</div><div>The gaping behavior will be monitored with electromagnetic sensors whose data will be collected together with the water quality data by a micocontroller unit (MCU). Measurements will be transmitted in real-time either via WI-FI or cellular network to a central server. After a pilot phase we plan to implement several of these Smart Sensing Stations across the campus. That way we will be able to characterize stromwater from different locations, assess stormwater toxicity from different locations, and monitor water quality at different locations within the watershed. We will create a project website where data and analysis will be posted.</div><div></div>

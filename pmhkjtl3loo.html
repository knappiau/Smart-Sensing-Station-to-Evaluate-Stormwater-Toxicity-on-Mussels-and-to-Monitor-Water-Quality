<div>           In order to productize the PCB sensor for in situ use, the FR-4 substrate material, which is the most common low-cost PCB material, will be replaced with liquid crystal polymer (LCP), which is a modern commercially used PCB material with a moisture permeability similar to glass <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Broadbent_2010}</cite>.&nbsp;This will allow the sensor to function accurately when continuously submerged in water, since FR4 will absorb moisture if submerged for long periods of time.&nbsp;The sensor will have three sensing elements: an electrical conductivity (EC) sensor, an EIS sensor, and a temperature sensor. The EC sensor will consist of two exposed Cu electrodes with a Au surface finish. Its interface circuit will consist of a AC bridge circuit, where the excitation frequency will be high enough to short the electrical double layer at each electrode, but low enough so as not to short the small parasitic capacitance that occurs in parallel with the solution's conductance. The EC sensor's cell constant will be empirically determined so that the sensor's measured electrical conductance can be converted to EC, when compensated for temperature. The EIS sensor will consist of an interdigitated Cu electrode structure under a layer of solder mask, where the fringing fields between the electrodes extend through the insulating solder mask layer and into the surrounding media. A low-cost, integrated sensor interface circuit will be used to interrogate the EIS sensorâ€™s impedance as a function of frequency, which possesses a resonant peak between 40 MHz and 50 MHz, and to transfer the resulting data to the data transmission MCU (Fig.&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{894273}</span>).&nbsp;The simplest interface circuit for replacing the full functionality of a laboratory vector network analyzer in this application is to make use of the large change in capacitance over a small frequency range around the resonant peak frequency, due to the electrochemical properties of the solution under test. By applying a sinusoid to the EIS sensor over this frequency span, where the sensor is used as a capacitor in a filter circuit, the relative delay of the signal through the filter will contain the desired information from the sensor. Then the interface circuit, which is similar to a lock-in amplifier, will produce a DC signal proportional to the change in sensor capacitance resulting from the electrochemical properties of the solution under test. The temperature sensor, which will be used to perform temperature compensation of the other two sensors, will consist of an attached off-the-shelf low-cost discrete temperature sensor, such as a thermistor. It will be protected from the environment by coating it with a water proof, electrical grade epoxy. A sensor interface circuit MCU will control the sensing operations and data processing, and will transfer the processed data to the system MCU. The sensing unit with all three sensors will be calibrated in the laboratory before being used in the field.</div>

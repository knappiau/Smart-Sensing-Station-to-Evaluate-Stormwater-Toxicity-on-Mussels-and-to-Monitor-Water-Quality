<div> 		Although there are many applications for environmental sensors that measure the impedance of a sample at a single frequency, additional information can sometimes be obtained by measuring the impedance at multiple frequencies or even over a wide range of frequencies. In environmental sensing applications, the sample under test is often an aqueous solution containing unknown contaminants, where it would be useful to identify the contaminants. Some chemicals that dissolve in or mix with water not only change the electrical properties of the water, but also change the electrical properties as a function of frequency, thereby creating an impedance versus frequency signature that can sometimes be used to identify the chemicals present in the aqueous solution. This type of analysis is called electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).</div>

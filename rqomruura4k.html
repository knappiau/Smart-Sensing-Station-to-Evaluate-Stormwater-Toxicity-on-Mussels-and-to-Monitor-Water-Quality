If drought conditions persist through 2017-2018, synthetic stormwater will be used in the experiment. Synthetic stormwater is an accepted substitute for real stormwater that can be logistically difficult to collect and store (Henderson et al. 2007; Hong et al. 2006). Vandalism of the experimental unit is another pitfall. The Arboretum curator recommended a small fence to delineate the BEWS boundary and low profile placement of the BEWS along the Arboretum stream. She and her staff have not had vandalism problems with past experiments or with current displays.&nbsp;</div>

The Alabama Cooperative Extension System (ACES) Water Resources Program &nbsp;in partnership with the project investigators has a strong program to provide science-based education on innovative stormwater management that includes the development of a Low Impact Development Handbook for Alabama, technical trainings for stormwater control measure design, implementation and maintenance, and a robust outreach program to the general public that works closely with Master Gardeners and homeowner stewardship responsibilities using Alabama Smart Yards manual and app.</div><div>Project investigators  work closely with stormwater professionals in Alabama for input and guidance on information needed to  improve water resources management. The ACES Water Resources Program has direct and frequent interactions with stormwater decision makers. We have &nbsp;conducted three statewide stormwater forums in 2014, 2016 and 2017 to bring together &nbsp;local and state government representatives, researchers, private industry, and concerned citizens. Each stormwater forum had over 100 participants and future stormwater forums will include research results from this project. We are also on the leadership planning team for a statewide stormwater association that meets 4 times a year to discuss current needs and identify future plans. Through these two organizations, we have the ability to reach entities that have direct management responsibilities for improved stormwater management in Alabama at the local and statewide level.</div><div>A common concern of &nbsp;local and state government employees is elected officials' lack of awareness of the connection between land use decisions and stormwater / water quality impacts. Further, recurring education is required as there is frequent turnover of elected officials. The ACES Water Program  provided water resources training in 2016 and 2017 to city councilmen and mayors  attending the Alabama League of Municipalities statewide events. Our programs were well received and we've been invited to future events. Participation in League of Municipalities continuing education events  provides an avenue to share implications of stormwater pollution, research results, and requests for future needs.</div><div>In Alabama, 4th grade students in 25 of  67 counties participate in Groundwater Festivals sponsored by city and county governments and the Alabama Department of Environmental Management. The Groundwater Festivals are hands-on demonstrations of the importance of water, impacts to water quality (especially non point source pollution), and simple strategies to protect water. Project investigators have worked closely with the Lee County Groundwater Festival planning and implementation. We also have a close relationship with the Alabama Department of Envrionmental Management's Nonpoint Source Division that assists in statewide coordination of Groundwater Festivals. We propose to refine curriculum content for the "Water Filtration" activity to include impacts of stormwater pollutants on aquatic biota. This partnership will reach thousands of students and volunteers each year.</div><div>The ACES Water Program is working with the City of Daphne in Baldwin County, one of the fastest growing counties in the nation, and the Baldwin County ACES to develop a 'Master Environmental Education' program 6th - 12th grade curriculum on stormwater impacts and solutions. Once developed, this pilot program will be transferable to other counties throughout the state in partnership with ACES and has the potential to reach thousands of students and teachers.</div><div>Project investigators will link with nature centers and museums throughout the state to provide resource materials and programs that reach general audiences. We will partner with the Auburn University Davis Arboretum and Krehler Forest Ecology Preserve to offer programs and resources for the general public. The Davis Arboretum is located in the heart of Auburn University's campus and has more than 10,000 visitors each year. Arboretum staff in partnership with several groups, including the ACES Water Program, developed an interactive stormwater trail accessible by QR code and guided pamphlet. We will update the tour to include a stop on stormwater impacts on stream life. We will also provide stormwater and water resource education events at the Arboretum as tours, seminars and workshops. The Krehler Forest Ecology Preserve offers environmental programs for the general public, summer camps for school age children and has statewide connections to other nature facilities (need to identify these other groups). We will partner with the Forest Ecology Preserve to provide transferable stormwater educational materials and programs for a general audience.&nbsp;</div><div>The School of Fisheries, Aquaculture and Aquatic Sciences has an interactive science center at the E.W. Shell Fisheries Center 2 miles north of Auburn University's main campus. The center provides a technology based experience of water's critical role in natural systems and economics (need help here). We will host tours and seminars at this facility in conjunction with events such as the well attended (over XX &nbsp;people) fish sales to highlight the connection of water resources to Alabama freshwater biodiversity.</div><div></div><div>* include a table that lists the target audiences and the  program / method to reach them.</div><div></div><div>There are a few example documents about broader impacts in the dropbox folder.</div><ul><li>Guidance</li><li>Technology transfer</li><li>Groundwater Festival</li><li>League of Municipalities</li><li>Aquatic Expo at North Auburn</li><li>Science Museum</li><li>Stormwater Forum &amp; AWRC</li><li>Include into tours at Arboretum</li></ul><h1 data-label="235032" class="ltx_title_section">Timeline</h1><div></div>

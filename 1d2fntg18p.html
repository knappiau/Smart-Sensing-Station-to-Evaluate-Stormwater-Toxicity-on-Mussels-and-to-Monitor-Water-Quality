Partial least squares regression is a chemometric method similar to principal component analysis. PLSR can be used to analyze spectra measurements from hundreds of wavelengths and to reduce them to a smaller number of components. The number of components necessary is selected by minimizing the root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP). <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Etheridge_2014}</cite>&nbsp;used PLSR to determine nutrient, dissolved organic carbon, and total suspended solids concentrations in brackish water. </div><h1 data-label="213259" class="ltx_title_section">Data Management Plan</h1><div>  	 		 		 	 	 	<span>All data created in this project will be stored in a data base. After the project is completed, all data, meta-data and analysis performed on the data will be stored in an R-package. The R- package will be publicly available for other researchers.&nbsp;</span></div><h1 data-label="213259" class="ltx_title_section">Potential Pitfalls</h1><div>Potential pitfalls include drought conditions that limit the opportunity to collect, treat, and analyze stormwater. If drought conditions persist through 2017-2018, synthetic stormwater will be used in the experiment. Synthetic stormwater is an accepted substitute for real stormwater that can be logistically difficult to collect and store&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{henderson_removal_2007,hong_sustainable_2006}</cite>. Vandalism of the experimental unit is another pitfall. We plan to fence in the area to keep unauthorized persons for accessing. Finally, the proposed water quality sensor could fail to pick up contaminant pulses that the mussels react on. In that case we would still have valuable data from the mussel's gaping behavior, the lethal und sublethal effects of stormwater on mussels, as well as the treatment effect of bioretention media on these effects.</div><h1 data-label="213259" class="ltx_title_section">Intelectual Merit</h1><div>Results from this project will improve our understanding of stormwater impacts on mussel species native to the Southeastern US. Mussel gaping data from the smart sensing stations will improve our understanding of stormwater pollutant transport in surface waters and effects on aquatic organisms. Based on this data it will be possible to prioritize stormwater mitigation efforts in highly urbanized watersheds. Finally, the water quality sensor could be implemented as a stand alone instrument - without the mussel gaping part - to monitor stormwater toxicity on a large spatial scale.</div><h1 data-label="213259" class="ltx_title_section"><b>Broader Impacts</b></h1><h2 data-label="298961" class="ltx_title_subsection">Science and technology advancement</h2><h2 data-label="298961" class="ltx_title_subsection"></h2><h2 data-label="436852" class="ltx_title_subsection">Training graduate and undergraduate students</h2><div>Four graduate students will be financially supported by this project. Undergraduate students will also be offered research experience and training in this project and supervised by the graduate students and faculty members. We strongly encourage and have track records of supporting undergraduate research training. Participating students will receive well-rounded and rigorous training in this project and benefit from exposure to the diverse science and engineering specializations involved in the proposed tasks.</div><h2 data-label="305665" class="ltx_title_subsection">Integrating the research results into curricula at AU</h2><div>  	 		 		 	 	 	The proposed research activities will provide ample opportunities to create new course modules for inclusion in both graduate and undergraduate levels in two colleges at Auburn University. The examples of specific courses that will benefit include CSES 5590 and 6590 (Environmental Soil Physics, lecture and lab) by Knappenberger, CSES 8580 (Fate and Transport of Chemicals in Soils, lecture) by Knappenberger, CSES 5080 and 6080 (Soil Resources and Conservation, lecture and lab) by Brantley, Fish 6970 (Conservation Ecology of Freshwater Mussels and Crayfish, lecture) by Stoeckel, Fish 7270 (Crustacean and Molluscan Aquaculture, lecture and lab) by Stoeckel, ELEC 4000 (Senior Design Projects, lecture) by Dean, ELEC 5760 (Solid State Sensors, lecture) by Dean. The proposed research also offers an opportunity for integrating students’ educational experience in a range of STEM research areas including engineering, agriculture and environmental science.</div><h2 data-label="364015" class="ltx_title_subsection">Engaging high school students in STEM</h2><div>In Alabama, 4th grade students in 25 of  67 counties participate in Groundwater Festivals sponsored by city and county governments and the Alabama Department of Environmental Management. The Groundwater Festivals are hands-on demonstrations of the importance of water, impacts to water quality (especially non point source pollution), and simple strategies to protect water. Project investigators have worked closely with the Lee County Groundwater Festival planning and implementation. We also have a close relationship with the Alabama Department of Envrionmental Management's Nonpoint Source Division that assists in statewide coordination of Groundwater Festivals. We propose to refine curriculum content for the "Water Filtration" activity to include impacts of stormwater pollutants on aquatic biota. This partnership will reach thousands of students and volunteers each year.</div><h2 data-label="367872" class="ltx_title_subsection">Disseminating the research to professional and lay audiences</h2><div>Target audiences identified for dissemination of research results include stormwater professionals (agency, local and state government, private industry),&nbsp;4th through 12th grade students, elected officials, and the general public. The Alabama Cooperative Extension System (ACES) Water Resources Program &nbsp;in partnership with the project investigators has a strong program to provide science-based education on innovative stormwater management that includes the development of a Low Impact Development Handbook for Alabama, technical trainings for stormwater control measure design, implementation and maintenance, and a robust outreach program to the general public that works closely with Master Gardeners and homeowner stewardship responsibilities using Alabama Smart Yards manual and app.</div><div>Project investigators  work closely with stormwater professionals in Alabama for input and guidance on information needed to  improve water resources management. The ACES Water Resources Program has direct and frequent interactions with stormwater decision makers. We have &nbsp;conducted three statewide stormwater forums in 2014, 2016 and 2017 to bring together &nbsp;local and state government representatives, researchers, private industry, and concerned citizens. Each stormwater forum had over 100 participants and future stormwater forums will include research results from this project. We are also on the leadership planning team for a statewide stormwater association that meets 4 times a year to discuss current needs and identify future plans. Through these two organizations, we have the ability to reach entities that have direct management responsibilities for improved stormwater management in Alabama at the local and statewide level.</div><div>A common concern of &nbsp;local and state government employees is elected officials' lack of awareness of the connection between land use decisions and stormwater / water quality impacts. Further, recurring education is required as there is frequent turnover of elected officials. The ACES Water Program  provided water resources training in 2016 and 2017 to city councilmen and mayors  attending the Alabama League of Municipalities statewide events. Our programs were well received and we've been invited to future events. Participation in League of Municipalities continuing education events  provides an avenue to share implications of stormwater pollution, research results, and requests for future needs.</div><div>The School of Fisheries, Aquaculture and Aquatic Sciences has an interactive science center at the E.W. Shell Fisheries Center  north of Auburn University's main campus. The center provides a technology based experience of water's critical role in natural systems and economics (need help here). We will host tours and seminars at this facility in conjunction with events such as the well attended  fish sales to highlight the connection of water resources to Alabama freshwater biodiversity.</div><div>The ACES Water Program is working with the City of Daphne in Baldwin County, one of the fastest growing counties in the nation, and the Baldwin County ACES to develop a 'Master Environmental Education' program 6th - 12th grade curriculum on stormwater impacts and solutions. Once developed, this pilot program will be transferable to other counties throughout the state in partnership with ACES and has the potential to reach thousands of students and teachers.</div><div>Project investigators will link with nature centers and museums throughout the state to provide resource materials and programs that reach general audiences. We will partner with the Auburn University Davis Arboretum and Krehler Forest Ecology Preserve to offer programs and resources for the general public. The Davis Arboretum is located in the heart of Auburn University's campus and has more than 10,000 visitors each year. Arboretum staff in partnership with several groups, including the ACES Water Program, developed an interactive stormwater trail accessible by QR code and guided pamphlet. We will update the tour to include a stop on stormwater impacts on stream life. We will also provide stormwater and water resource education events at the Arboretum as tours, seminars and workshops. The Krehler Forest Ecology Preserve offers environmental programs for the general public, summer camps for school age children and has statewide connections to other nature facilities (need to identify these other groups). We will partner with the Forest Ecology Preserve to provide transferable stormwater educational materials and programs for a general audience.&nbsp;</div><h1 data-label="235032" class="ltx_title_section">Timeline</h1><div>This will we a 3 year project.</div><div>Draft time line:</div><div>Year 1:</div><ul><li>Collection and characterization of stormwater</li><li>Sensor development</li><li>Smart Sensing Station construction</li></ul><div>Year 2:</div><ul><li>Smart Sensing Station goes online</li><li>Determination of Sublethal effects</li><li>Correlation of water quality sensor data to mussel gaping behavior</li></ul><div>Year 3:</div><ul><li>2 year of Smart Sensing Station data collection</li><li>Finalize data analysis</li><li>Dissimilation, report writing, publication</li></ul><div></div>

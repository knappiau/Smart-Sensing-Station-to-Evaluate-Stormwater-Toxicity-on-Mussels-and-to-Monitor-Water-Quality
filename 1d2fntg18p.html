Partial least squares regression is a chemometric method similar to principal component analysis. PLSR can be used to analyze spectra measurements from hundreds of wavelengths and to reduce them to a smaller number of components. The number of components necessary is selected by minimizing the root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP). <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Etheridge_2014}</cite>&nbsp;used PLSR to determine nutrient, dissolved organic carbon, and total suspended solids concentrations in brackish water. </div><h1 data-label="213259" class="ltx_title_section">Data Management Plan</h1><div>  	 		 		 	 	 	<span>All data created in this project will be stored in a data base.

The R- package will be publicly available for other researchers.&nbsp;</span></div><h1 data-label="213259" class="ltx_title_section">Potential Pitfalls</h1><div>Potential pitfalls include drought conditions that limit the opportunity to collect, treat, and analyze stormwater. If drought conditions persist through 2017-2018, synthetic stormwater will be used in the experiment. Synthetic stormwater is an accepted substitute for real stormwater that can be logistically difficult to collect and store&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{henderson_removal_2007,hong_sustainable_2006}</cite>. Vandalism of the experimental unit is another pitfall. We plan to fence in the area to keep unauthorized persons for accessing. Finally, the proposed water quality sensor could fail to pick up contaminant pulses that the mussels react on. In that case we would still have valuable data from the mussel's gaping behavior, the lethal und sublethal effects of stormwater on mussels, as well as the treatment effect of bioretention media on these effects.</div><h1 data-label="213259" class="ltx_title_section">Intelectual Merit</h1><div>Results from this project will improve our understanding of stormwater impacts on mussel species native to the Southeastern US. Mussel gaping data from the smart sensing stations will improve our understanding of stormwater pollutant transport in surface waters and effects on aquatic organisms. Based on this data it will be possible to prioritize stormwater mitigation efforts in highly urbanized watersheds. Finally, the water quality sensor could be implemented as a stand alone instrument - without the mussel gaping part - to monitor stormwater toxicity on a large spatial scale.</div><h1 data-label="213259" class="ltx_title_section"><b>Broader Impacts</b></h1><h2 data-label="298961" class="ltx_title_subsection">Science and technology advancement</h2><h2 data-label="469501" class="ltx_title_subsection">Contribution to the next generation of faculty, scientists and engineers</h2><h2 data-label="332782" class="ltx_title_subsection">Recruitment of students, especially underrepresented (UREP) group</h2><h2 data-label="436852" class="ltx_title_subsection">Training graduate and undergraduate students</h2><div>Four graduate students will be financially supported by this project.

The examples of specific courses that will benefit include CSES 6060 and 6061 (Soil microbiology lecture and lab) by Feng, MATL 7410 (Chemical Sensors) by Chin, MATL 7970 (Materials for Energy Storage/Conversion) by Beidaghi, MATL 5720/6720 (Biomedical Applications of Polymers) by Davis, BSEN 5510/6510 (Ecological Engineering) and BSEN 7970 (Engineering for Algae Systems) by Blersch, BCHE 7230 (Biochemistry of Macromolecules) by Mansoorabadi, and MATL 7420 (Smart Materials) by Cheng. The proposed research also offers an opportunity for integrating students’ educational experience in a range of STEM research areas including nanomaterials, energy science, physical chemistry, agriculture and environmental science.</div>

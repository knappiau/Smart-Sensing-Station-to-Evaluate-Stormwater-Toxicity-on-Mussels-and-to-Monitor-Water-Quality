<h2 data-label="161369" class="ltx_title_subsection"></h2><h2>Objective 2: Determine lethal and sublethal effects of treated and un-treated stormwater on mussels</h2><div>Stormwater will be collected from stormwater flumes during storms and half of the samplestorms that do, and do not set off alarms and stored in amber glass bottles frozen at -20C. Frozen stormwater has been shown to retain its toxicity for at least 2 months following collection&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{mcintyre_zebrafish_2014}</cite>. Within 2 months of collection, samples will be thawed and mussels exposed to untreated and treated storm water to determine the degree to which treatment ameliorates lethal and sublethal effects.</div>

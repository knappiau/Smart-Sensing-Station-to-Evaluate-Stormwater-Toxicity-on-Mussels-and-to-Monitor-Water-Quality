<div> Lethal effects result in  death after a certain period of exposure to a specific concentration. However,  a given stressor may have a detrimental effect without causing mortality. This  is termed a sublethal effect. Sublethal effects are wide ranging and include  reduced growth and reproduction, behavioral anomalies, and altered metabolic  rates. Respiration rates of mussels can be altered by metals and  nitrogenous wastes&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{wang_metal_2005,zhao_environmental_2014}</cite>. This in turn can strongly alter energetic budgets  of organisms&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{mueller_regulation_2011}</cite>, and lead to strong effects on scope for  growth . Jim Stoeckel is currently conducting  research to assess how thermal and chemical stressors affect metabolic patterns  of mussels. In the proposed study, we will compare effects of  treated and untreated stormwater on mussels  using a combination of  lethal effect assays focusing on mortality, and sublethal assays focusing on respiration  rates as a sensitive indicator of sublethal metabolic stress that can lead to  changes in an individualâ€™s scope for growth. <b>We have found no research on the response of Alabama native  mussels to treated or untreated stormwater.</b></div><div></div><div><b>Embedded computer system:&nbsp;</b>We will use Raspberry Pis as frameworks for our sensor system (<a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org" target="_blank">www.raspberrypi.org</a>). Raspberry Pis are economical, yet powerful and affordable micro computer systems. Recently, Raspberry Pis have been used in geosciences&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{moure_use_2015,morschhauser_low-power_2017}</cite>, automation&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{noorshams_automating_2017,todd_fully_2017}</cite>, image analysis&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{lopez-ruiz_portable_2017}</cite>, signal processing&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{pasolini_raspberry_2017}</cite>, forecasting&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{sukic_intra-minute_2017,richardson_low_2017}</cite>, as well as environmental&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{lewis_performance_2016,perri_inexpensive_2016,xu_raspberry_2016,segura-garcia_low-cost_2015,robson_making_2015,salcedo_using_2016,gurdita_simple_2016}</cite> and water quality monitoring&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{vijayakumar_real_2015,murphy_low-cost_2015,kartakis_waterbox:_2015,ibrahim_internet_2015}</cite>. Using a Raspberry Pi has many advantages over other computer or micro controller systems: They run a linux based operating system which makes it easy to implement the sensor algorithms (which were developed in objective 2) including specific R or python&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{guerra_remote_2016,obrien_harnessing_2017,noorshams_automating_2017}</cite> packages. Another advantage of the linux based operating system is that it is easy to implement a web server which means it would be possible to access the stations data directly through an internet browser. Raspberry Pis are equipped with basic I/O architecture like flash card reader, ethernet, USB, etc which lowers development costs. A powerful CPU and more RAM allow us to perform high performance computations directly on the smart sensing station.&nbsp;</div>

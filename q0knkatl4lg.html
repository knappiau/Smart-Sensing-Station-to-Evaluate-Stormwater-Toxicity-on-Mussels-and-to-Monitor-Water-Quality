<div> 					Commercial printed circuit board (PCB) technology is being used to realize a low- cost environmental sensor.&nbsp; The non-conductive FR-4 substrate forms a rigid backbone for the sensing element. The patterned Cu cladding is used for sensing electrodes and signal traces. The polymeric solder mask serves as a thin insulating and moisture barrier layer. Four electrodes covered with solder mask are on the top side, where the solder mask electrically insulates them from the sensing environment. These electrodes can be used to measure the electrical permittivity or the electrical perme</div>

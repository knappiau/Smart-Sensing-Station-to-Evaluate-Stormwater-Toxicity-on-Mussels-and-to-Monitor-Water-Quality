<div> 					Commercial printed circuit board (PCB) technology is being used to realize a low- cost environmental sensor.&nbsp; The non-conductive FR-4 substrate forms a rigid backbone for the sensing element. The patterned Cu cladding is used for sensing electrodes and signal traces. The polymeric solder mask serves as a thin insulating and moisture barrier layer. Four electrodes covered with solder mask are on the top side, where the solder mask electrically insulates them from the sensing environment. These electrodes can be used to measure the electrical permittivity or the electrical permeability of the surrounding media. Two exposed electrodes are shown on the bottom side which can be used to measure the resistance and therefore the electrical conductivity of the surrounding media. Through measuring these electrical properties of the surrounding environment, useful information about the environment can be ascertained, such as salinity&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Dean_2016}</cite>, soil moisture content&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Dean_2010}</cite>, nitrate concentration&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Yunus_2011}</cite>, pH&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Zoolfakar_2010}</cite>, water supply contamination&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Amri_Md_Yunus_2015}</cite>,and the mass of a drop of wa</div>

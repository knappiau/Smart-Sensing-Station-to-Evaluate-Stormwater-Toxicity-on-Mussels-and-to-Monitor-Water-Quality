<div><b>Lethal effects: </b>Treated and untreated stormwater will be thawed and 500 ml poured into glass beakers for a total of three replicate beakers per treatment. An additional three beakers will be filled with 500 ml of reconstituted freshwater as a control. Ten mussels will be placed in each beaker with light aeration and held at the original stormwater collection temperature for 48 hours. At the end of that period, mortality will be recorded and differences in mortality among treatments  will be tested. </div>

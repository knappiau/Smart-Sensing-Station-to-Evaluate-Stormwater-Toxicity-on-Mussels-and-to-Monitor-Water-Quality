Today, a vast number of water quality parameters are sampled from
surface waters and stormwater catchments. However, these samples are
taken at discrete time intervals and are usually not able to capture
pulses or plumes of contaminants. Continuous monitoring is necessary to
capture and understand spatial and temporal contaminant distributions.
Although water quality samples are taken to test the toxicity of a water
body, oftentimes the water quality data does not relate to actual
toxicity of individual species or toxicity data is available for certain
species but only lethal effects were studied.

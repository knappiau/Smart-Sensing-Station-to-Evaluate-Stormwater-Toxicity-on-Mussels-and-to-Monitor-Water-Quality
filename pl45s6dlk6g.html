These ponds are isolated from stormwater runoff and other contaminant sources and used to supply mussels for research. Each mussel will be fitted with high frequency electromagnetic induction sensors attached to the shells of the mussels to monitor gaping behavior. Gaping behavior patterns are monitored using computer software (e.g. Presentit2) that analyzes for departure from "normal" patterns (e.g. closure, reduced opening, gaping). When abnormal patterns are detected, an alarm specific to that behavior is set off and the user is alerted.</div><div>Automated ISCO samplers, deployed at the site, will be used to collect time series of samples. During periods when stormwater is present, BEWS alarms will indicate the likely presence of toxicants. Samples prior to, and during BEWS alarms will be shipped to Eurofins Inc. analytical laboratories for analysis of a suite of potential toxicants.&nbsp;</div><div>These data will allow us to 1) characterize suites of contaminants that trigger BEWS alarms by mussels, 2) assess the bioretention cell for contaminant reduction below thresholds that trigger BEWS alarms, and 3) link contaminant concentrations and animal behavior to electrochemical properties of the water sample.</div><div></div>

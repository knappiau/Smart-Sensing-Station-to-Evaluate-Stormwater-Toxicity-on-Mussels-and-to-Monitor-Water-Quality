<div><b>Expected Outcome:</b> These data will allow us to 1) characterize suites of contaminants that trigger BEWS alarms by mussels, 2) assess the bioretention cell for contaminant reduction below thresholds that trigger BEWS alarms, and 3) link contaminant concentrations and animal behavior to electrochemical properties of the water sample.</div>

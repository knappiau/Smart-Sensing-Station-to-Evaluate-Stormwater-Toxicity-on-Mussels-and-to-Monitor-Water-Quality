<div><b>Expected Outcome:</b> These data will allow us to 1) characterize suites of contaminants that trigger BEWS alarms by mussels, 2) assess the bioretention cell for contaminant reduction below thresholds that trigger BEWS alarms, and 3) link contaminant concentrations and animal behavior to electrochemical properties of the water sample.</div><h2 data-label="161369" class="ltx_title_subsection">Objective 4: Identify priority areas and mitigate stormwater impacts</h2><div>  	 		 		 	 	 		 					After a pilot phase we plan to implement several of these Smart Sensing Stations across Auburn University campus. Fig.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>That way we will be able to characterize stromwater from different locations, assess stormwater toxicity from different locations, and monitor water quality at different locations within the watershed. We will create a project website where data and analysis will be posted.</div><div></div>

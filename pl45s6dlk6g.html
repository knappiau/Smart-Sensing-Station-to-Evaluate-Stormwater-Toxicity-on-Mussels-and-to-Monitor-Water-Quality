<h2 data-label="161369" class="ltx_title_subsection">Mussel Monitoring</h2><div>  	 		 		 	 	 		We will build a biological early warning system and bioretention facility at the Donald E. Davis Arboretum to test and demonstrate the previously described approaches to the problem of stormwater effluent. The Arboretum is an ideal site for this study because it is a natural area located on the university campus, and contains a small stream that receives stormwater from the Poultry Science parking lot and from Lem Morrison Drive.&nbsp;</div><div> 					A small structure will be built on the left bank of the stream to house the BEWS and small bioretention modules utilized for Phase 1 (Figure 3), based on designs and constraints discussed and approved by the Arboretum Curator (L. Morgan Beadles, pers. Comm; see letter of support)&nbsp;</div><div></div>

<div>We will construct three mussel BEWS based on the published design of commercially available Musselmonitors (AquaDect, Netherlands), and populate them with <i>Lampsilis straminea</i>, a mussel commonly found in Alabama streams and currently grown by James Stoeckel in mussel "farming" ponds at the Alabama Agricultural Experimental Station. These ponds are isolated from stormwater runoff and other contaminant sources and used to supply mussels for research. Each mussel will be fitted with high frequency electromagnetic induction sensors attached to the shells of the mussels to monitor gaping behavior. Gaping behavior patterns are monitored using computer software (e.g. Presentit2) that analyzes for departure from "normal" patterns (e.g. closure, reduced opening, gaping). When abnormal patterns are detected, an alarm specific to that behavior is set off and the user is alerted.</div>

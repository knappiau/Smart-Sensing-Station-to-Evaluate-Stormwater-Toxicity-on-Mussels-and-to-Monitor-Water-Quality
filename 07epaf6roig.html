The non-conductive FR-4 substrate forms a rigid backbone for the sensing element. The patterned Cu cladding is used for sensing electrodes and signal traces. The polymeric solder mask serves as a thin insulating and moisture barrier layer. Four electrodes covered with solder mask are on the top side, where the solder mask electrically insulates them from the sensing environment. These electrodes can be used to measure the electrical permittivity or the electrical permeability of the surrounding media. Two exposed electrodes are shown on the bottom side which can be used to measure the resistance and therefore the electrical conductivity of the surrounding media. Through measuring these electrical properties of the surrounding environment, useful information about the environment can be ascertained, such as salinity&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Dean_2016}</cite>, soil moisture content&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Dean_2010}</cite>, nitrate concentration&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Yunus_2011}</cite>, pH&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Zoolfakar_2010}</cite>, water supply contamination&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Amri_Md_Yunus_2015}</cite>,and the mass of a drop of water <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Meng_2016}</cite>.&nbsp;</div><h3 data-label="249968" class="ltx_title_subsubsection"><span>Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy&nbsp;</span></h3><div> 				Although there are many applications for environmental sensors that measure the impedance of a sample at a single frequency, additional information can sometimes be obtained by measuring the impedance at multiple frequencies or even over a wide range of frequencies. In environmental sensing applications, the sample under test is often an aqueous solution containing unknown contaminants, where it would be useful to determine what the contaminants are. Some chemicals that dissolve in or mix with water not only change the electrical properties of the water, but also change the electrical properties as a function of frequency, thereby creating an impedance versus frequency signature that can sometimes be used to identify the chemicals present in the aqueous solution. This type of analysis is called electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).</div><div>Water is one of the most studied compounds. It is a polar molecule with an electrical resistivity of approximately 18.18 MΩ-cm at 25C&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Light_2005}</cite>, and a relative permittivity of approximately 78.3 at 25oC&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Schwan_1976}</cite>. The electrical properties of water are temperature dependent&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Malmberg_1956}</cite>. When an ionic compound dissolves in water, the ions become mobile charge carriers, which results in a decrease in the low frequency electrical resistivity of the aqueous solution, since ions move much slower in a solution than electrons move in a solid conductor. Additionally, dissolved ions, such as the nitrate ion, form physically large and concentration dependent hydration shells with water molecules. Due to their large size, these hydration shells possess a relatively low mechanical resonant frequency, which can be excited into vibration by applying RF energy at relatively low frequencies, on the order of tens of MHz&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Chighladze_2010}</cite>. This electromechanical phenomenon, known as relaxation, results in a frequency dependent complex permittivity. Other compounds, with much lower dielectric constants than water, can mix with water to alter the dielectric constant of the resulting aqueous solution. These effects cause the sensor’s impedance to be a function of both the chemistry of the solution and the excitation frequency at which the sensor’s impedance is measured.</div><h3 data-label="943515" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Measuring Impedance as a Function of Frequency</h3><div>A vector network analyzer can be used to measure impedance as a function of frequency.

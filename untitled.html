<h1 data-label="767280" class="ltx_title_section">Abstract</h1><h1 data-label="765106" class="ltx_title_section">Introduction</h1><div>Nonpoint source pollution originating from stormwater is the  main cause of surface water degradation in Alabama and the USA. Stormwater  contaminants vary depending on the land use, i.e. urban, residential, industrial,  agricultural, or forested areas. Urban land use increases impervious surfaces,  such as roads, parking lots, and rooftops. These surfaces accumulate contaminants  such as:</div><ul><li>nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus)</li><li>total suspended solids</li><li>metals (copper, zinc)</li><li>polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (oils, gasoline)</li></ul><div>Impervious surfaces do not infiltrate stormwater and conventional  stormwater management directs contaminant-laden effluent to a storm sewer  system that discharges directly to a stream, river, or lake. Alabama’s  streams and rivers host the greatest biodiversity of freshwater mussels (~182  species) and crayfish (~83 species) in the world. Today, more than half of  these species are threatened and declining. Degradation of water quality and  habitat by urban use poses a major threat to remaining freshwater biodiversity  – particularly in Alabama, but in other states as well.</div><div></div>

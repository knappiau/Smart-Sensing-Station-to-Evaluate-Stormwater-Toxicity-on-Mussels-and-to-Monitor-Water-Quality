Stormwater  contaminants vary depending on the land use, i.e., urban, residential, industrial,  agricultural, or forested areas. Urban land use increases impervious surfaces,  such as roads, parking lots, and rooftops. These surfaces accumulate contaminants  such as nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus), suspended solids, heavy metals (copper, zinc, lead, chromium, cadmium), and&nbsp;polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (oils, gasoline).</div><div>Stormwater does not infiltrate impervious surfaces and conventional  stormwater management directs contaminant-laden effluent to a storm sewer  system that discharges directly to a stream, river, or lake. Alabama’s  streams and rivers host the greatest biodiversity of freshwater mussels (~182  species)  in the world. Today, more than half of  these species are threatened and declining. Degradation of water quality and  habitat by urban use poses a major threat to remaining freshwater biodiversity  – particularly in Alabama, but in other states as well.</div><div></div><h2>Stormwater Effects on Aquatic Organisms</h2>

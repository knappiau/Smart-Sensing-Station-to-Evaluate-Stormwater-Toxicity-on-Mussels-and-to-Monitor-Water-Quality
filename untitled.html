<h1 data-label="767280" class="ltx_title_section">Abstract</h1><h1 data-label="765106" class="ltx_title_section">Introduction</h1><div>Nonpoint source pollution originating from stormwater is the  main cause of surface water degradation in Alabama and the USA <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{us-epa_assessed_2017}</cite>. Stormwater  contaminants vary depending on the land use, i.e. urban, residential, industrial,  agricultural, or forested areas. Urban land use increases impervious surfaces,  such as roads, parking lots, and rooftops. These surfaces accumulate contaminants  such as:</div><ul><li>nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus)</li><li>total suspended solids</li><li>metals (copper, zinc)</li><li>polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (oils, gasoline)</li></ul><div>Impervious surfaces do not infiltrate stormwater and conventional  stormwater management directs contaminant-laden effluent to a storm sewer  system that discharges directly to a stream, river, or lake. Alabama’s  streams and rivers host the greatest biodiversity of freshwater mussels (~182  species) and crayfish (~83 species) in the world. Today, more than half of  these species are threatened and declining. Degradation of water quality and  habitat by urban use poses a major threat to remaining freshwater biodiversity  – particularly in Alabama, but in other states as well.</div><h1 data-label="212446" class="ltx_title_section">Stormwater Treatment with Bioretention Media</h1><div>Low impact development (LID), or green stormwater  infrastructure, involves innovative stormwater management that treats the  first, most polluted, flush of stormwater before it reaches a stream, river, or  lake. Bioretention cells, a LID stormwater control measure, have been  implemented in a small number of Alabama communities. Bioretention cells are  constructed depressions in the  landscape that capture and store stormwater for less than 48 hours (Figure  1). The components include an underlying  specialized soil media that is specific to individual regions or states. In  Alabama, the recommended soil media is 85-88% sand, 8-12 % fines, and 3-5%  organic matter&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{dylewski_lid_2014}</cite>&nbsp;.</div><div></div><div><a>Figure </a>1: Cross section of typical  bioretention cell (Alabama LID Handbook)</div><div></div><div>Bioretention cells treat stormwater by settling, filtration,  and internal processes and research has shown wide ranging, but generally large  (greater than 50%), reductions in concentrations of contaminants after treatment.

Phosphorus leaching (especially soluble phosphorus) appeared  to originate from fill media and surface mulch sources, especially with high  organic or compost constituents, or from other decomposing organic sources such  as grass clippings remaining in the facility&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{davis_allen_p._bioretention_2009,passeport_elodie_field_2009,hatt_hydrologic_2009}</cite>.

Reduction in TSS appears to be one of the most  consistently improved water quality parameters in LID bioretention treatment <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{brown_robert_a._impacts_2011}</cite>. <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{davis_allen_p._bioretention_2009}</cite>&nbsp;found heavy metals, both dissolved  and particulate-bound, were efficiently removed in bioretention facilities, and  that most of the removal occurs in the upper layers of the media <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{li_heavy_2008}</cite>.</div><div><cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{diblasi_removal_2009}</cite>&nbsp;noted that polycyclic aromatic  hydrocarbons were rapidly adsorbed and transported only a few centimeters  beneath the surface in a bioretention facility, and did not pose a hazardous  waste threat to either solid waste disposal of surface sediments or to  groundwater; use of special sorbents is unnecessary for PAHs in bioretention  facilities. Oil and grease (including motor oils) are a substantial contaminant  in road surface storm runoff. Like metals, oil and grease is removed through  bioretention facilities&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{davis_allen_p._bioretention_2009}</cite>. <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{chapman_performance_2010}</cite>&nbsp;found  consistently low minimum outflow concentrations of motor oil after treatment  through their project facility.</div><div>Although research has been conducted to evaluate nutrient  removal of bioretention cells in Alabama <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{christian_effect_2012,mark_dougherty_evaluation_2007}</cite>, there is no information on contaminants such as metals and  polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. More research on bioretention cells in  Alabama soils, climate, and stormwater is needed to evaluate the pollutant  removal effectiveness of the recommended soil media.</div><h1 data-label="664382" class="ltx_title_section">Stormwater Effects on Aquatic Organisms</h1><div>Stormwater typically contains a wide array of contaminants  such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), metals, and pesticides. Runoff  transports  contaminants to receiving waters, many of which are toxic to fish&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{skinner_developmental_1999,kayhanian_toxicity_2008,corsi_fresh_2010}</cite>, invertebrates&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{hall_toxicity_1988,marsalek_exploratory_1999,kayhanian_toxicity_2008,corsi_fresh_2010}</cite>, and aquatic plants&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{kayhanian_toxicity_2008}</cite>. In the western U.S.,  research on coho salmon (<i>Oncorhynchus  kisutch</i>), daphnia (<i>Ceriodaphnia dubia</i>),  mayfly (<i>Baetis spp</i>.), and zebra fish  (<i>Danio rerio</i>) that were exposed to  untreated stormwater revealed devastating lethal and sublethal effects on these  organisms&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{mcintyre_zebrafish_2014,mcintyre_soil_2015,spromberg_coho_2016}</cite>. Untreated runoff caused heart failure, delayed hatching, reduced growth,  pericardial edema, microphthalmia (small eyes), and reduced swim bladder  inflation in zebra fish&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{mcintyre_zebrafish_2014}</cite>. Untreated stormwater runoff  was generally lethal to salmon and invertebrates and sublethal reproductive  toxicity was detected in daphnia&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{mcintyre_soil_2015}</cite>. Untreated stormwater runoff  collected during nine storms was universally lethal to adult coho salmon <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{spromberg_coho_2016}</cite> .</div><div>In  contrast, lethal and sublethal effects decreased or were un-detectible after  the stormwater was treated by flushing through a bioretention cell: Using a bioretention  soil medium that was composed of 60% sand, 15% compost, 15% shredded bark, and  10% drinking water treatment residuals by volume, the bioretention treatment  dramatically improved stormwater quality and reversed nearly all forms of  developmental toxicity&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{mcintyre_zebrafish_2014}</cite>. Similarly, bioretention soil  media reduced or eliminate toxicity to juvenile Coho salmon as well as their  macroinvertebrate prey, including cultured daphnia and wild-collected mayfly <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{mcintyre_soil_2015}</cite>. Stormwater flushed through a soil medium containing  60% sand and 40% compost was not toxic to Coho salmon and mortality was  prevented by the stormwater treatment.&nbsp;<b>However,  we have not found research that focuses on the Alabama bioretention soil mix  (85% sand, 10% fines, 5% organics) and aquatic organisms that are native to  Alabama and the Southeastern U.S.</b></div><div></div>

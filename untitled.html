Stormwater  contaminants vary depending on the land use, i.e. urban, residential, industrial,  agricultural, or forested areas. Urban land use increases impervious surfaces,  such as roads, parking lots, and rooftops. These surfaces accumulate contaminants  such as nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus), suspended solids, heavy metals (copper, zinc, lead, chromium, cadmium), and&nbsp;polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (oils, gasoline).</div><div>Impervious surfaces do not infiltrate stormwater and conventional  stormwater management directs contaminant-laden effluent to a storm sewer  system that discharges directly to a stream, river, or lake. Alabama’s  streams and rivers host the greatest biodiversity of freshwater mussels (~182  species) and crayfish (~83 species) in the world. Today, more than half of  these species are threatened and declining. Degradation of water quality and  habitat by urban use poses a major threat to remaining freshwater biodiversity  – particularly in Alabama, but in other states as well.</div><h2 data-label="608783" class="ltx_title_subsection">Stormwater Treatment with Bioretention Media</h2><div>Low impact development (LID), or green stormwater  infrastructure, involves innovative stormwater management that treats the  first, most polluted, flush of stormwater before it reaches a stream, river, or  lake. Bioretention cells, a LID stormwater control measure, have been  implemented in a small number of Alabama communities. Bioretention cells are  constructed depressions in the  landscape that capture and store stormwater for less than 48 hours (Figure  1). The components include an underlying  specialized soil media that is specific to individual regions or states. In  Alabama, the recommended soil media is 85-88% sand, 8-12 % fines, and 3-5%  organic matter&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{dylewski_lid_2014}</cite>&nbsp;. Recommended bioretention media in other states ranges in sand content from 30-90% with silts, clays, organic matter, and compost being the other constituents.</div><div></div><div><a>Figure </a>1: Cross section of typical  bioretention cell (Alabama LID Handbook)</div><div></div><div>Bioretention cells treat stormwater by settling, filtration,  and internal processes and research has shown wide ranging, but generally large  (greater than 50%), reductions in concentrations of contaminants after treatment.

More research on bioretention cells in  Alabama soils, climate, and stormwater is needed to evaluate the pollutant  removal effectiveness of the recommended soil media.</div><h2 data-label="733980" class="ltx_title_subsection">Stormwater Effects on Aquatic Organisms</h2><div>Stormwater typically contains a wide array of contaminants  such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), metals, and pesticides. Runoff  transports  contaminants to receiving waters, many of which are toxic to fish&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{skinner_developmental_1999,kayhanian_toxicity_2008,corsi_fresh_2010}</cite>, invertebrates&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{hall_toxicity_1988,marsalek_exploratory_1999,kayhanian_toxicity_2008,corsi_fresh_2010}</cite>, and aquatic plants&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{kayhanian_toxicity_2008}</cite>. In the western U.S.,  research on coho salmon (<i>Oncorhynchus  kisutch</i>), daphnia (<i>Ceriodaphnia dubia</i>),  mayfly (<i>Baetis spp</i>.), and zebra fish  (<i>Danio rerio</i>) that were exposed to  untreated stormwater revealed devastating lethal and sublethal effects on these  organisms&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{mcintyre_zebrafish_2014,mcintyre_soil_2015,spromberg_coho_2016}</cite>. Untreated runoff caused heart failure, delayed hatching, reduced growth,  pericardial edema, microphthalmia (small eyes), and reduced swim bladder  inflation in zebra fish&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{mcintyre_zebrafish_2014}</cite>. Untreated stormwater runoff  was generally lethal to salmon and invertebrates and sublethal reproductive  toxicity was detected in daphnia&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{mcintyre_soil_2015}</cite>. Untreated stormwater runoff  collected during nine storms was universally lethal to adult coho salmon <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{spromberg_coho_2016}</cite> .</div><div>In  contrast, lethal and sublethal effects decreased or were un-detectible after  the stormwater was treated by flushing through a bioretention cell: Using a bioretention  soil medium that was composed of 60% sand, 15% compost, 15% shredded bark, and  10% drinking water treatment residuals by volume, the bioretention treatment  dramatically improved stormwater quality and reversed nearly all forms of  developmental toxicity&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{mcintyre_zebrafish_2014}</cite>. Similarly, bioretention soil  media reduced or eliminate toxicity to juvenile Coho salmon as well as their  macroinvertebrate prey, including cultured daphnia and wild-collected mayfly <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{mcintyre_soil_2015}</cite>. Stormwater flushed through a soil medium containing  60% sand and 40% compost was not toxic to Coho salmon and mortality was  prevented by the stormwater treatment.&nbsp;<b>However,  we have not found research that focuses on the Alabama bioretention soil mix  (85% sand, 10% fines, 5% organics) and aquatic organisms that are native to  Alabama and the Southeastern U.S.</b></div><h2 data-label="803535" class="ltx_title_subsection">Biological Early Warning Systems</h2><div>Biological early warning systems provide behavioral and  physiological response alerts when contaminants pulse down waterways in concentrations  that are likely to have negative effects on aquatic communities&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{bae2014biological}</cite>. Behavioral responses of bivalves can serve as a valuable early warning  system. Mussels must keep their shells open to obtain food and oxygen from the  surrounding waters. However, they respond to toxicants and close their shells.  Electromagnetic sensors attached to each valve are used to monitor gaping and  closing behavior and set off alarms when behavior indicates the presence of  stressful toxicants in the water&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{manley_behavioural_1979,kramer_valve_1989,gnyubkin_early_2009}</cite>. Systems such as the Mosselmonitor (<a href="http://www.mosselmonitor.nl" target="_blank">www.mosselmonitor.nl</a>; <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citealt{kramer_valve_1989}</cite> ) and the Dreissena Monitor (Envicontrol Köln Germany; <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citealt{borcherding_dreissena-monitor_1994}</cite>) have been used to monitor fresh and saltwater environments  in Europe.</div><div>Effects of toxicants and other stressors on organisms can be  divided into two categories: lethal and sublethal. Lethal effects result in  death after a certain period of exposure to a specific concentration. However,  a given stressor may have a detrimental effect without causing mortality. This  is termed a sublethal effect. Sublethal effects are wide ranging and include  reduced growth and reproduction, behavioral anomalies, and altered metabolic  rates. Respiration rates of mussels and crayfish can be altered by metals and  nitrogenous wastes&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{meade_toxicity_1995,rowe_metabolic_2001,wang_metal_2005}</cite>. This in turn can strongly alter energetic budgets  of organisms&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{mueller_regulation_2011}</cite>, and lead to strong effects on scope for  growth . Jim Stoeckel is currently conducting  research to assess how thermal and chemical stressors affect metabolic patterns  of mussels. In the proposed study, we will compare effects of  treated and untreated stormwater on mussels and crayfish using a combination of  lethal effect assays focusing on mortality, and sublethal assays focusing on respiration  rates as a sensitive indicator of sublethal metabolic stress that can lead to  changes in an individual’s scope for growth (Figure 2). <b>We have found no research on the response of Alabama native  mussels to treated or untreated stormwater.</b></div><h2 data-label="145928" class="ltx_title_subsection"><b>Status of Water Quality Sensing</b></h2><h1 data-label="213259" class="ltx_title_section">Approach</h1><h2 data-label="161369" class="ltx_title_subsection">Overview (including schematic)</h2><div>Lorem Ipsum</div><h2 data-label="161369" class="ltx_title_subsection">Theory</h2><h3 data-label="165994" class="ltx_title_subsubsection"><span>Printed Circuit Board Environmental Sensors&nbsp;</span></h3><div> 					Commercial printed circuit board (PCB) technology is being used to realize low- cost environmental sensors.  The non-conductive FR-4 substrate forms a rigid backbone for the sensing element. The patterned Cu cladding is used for sensing electrodes and signal traces. The polymeric solder mask serves as a thin insulating and moisture barrier layer. Four electrodes covered with solder mask are on the top side, where the solder mask electrically insulates them from the sensing environment. These electrodes can be used to measure the electrical permittivity or the electrical permeability of the surrounding media. Two exposed electrodes are shown on the bottom side which can be used to measure the resistance and therefore the electrical conductivity of the surrounding media.

In environmental sensing applications, the sample under test is often an aqueous solution containing unknown contaminants, where it would be useful to determine what the contaminants are. Some chemicals that dissolve in or mix with water not only change the electrical properties of the water, but also change the electrical properties as a function of frequency, thereby creating an impedance versus frequency signature that can sometimes be used to identify the chemicals present in the aqueous solution. This type of analysis is called electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).</div><div>Water is one of the most studied compounds. It is a polar molecule with an electrical resistivity of approximately 18.18 MΩ-cm at 25C&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Light_2005}</cite>, and a relative permittivity of approximately 78.3 at 25oC&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Schwan_1976}</cite>. The electrical properties of water are temperature dependent&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Malmberg_1956}</cite>. When an ionic compound dissolves in water, the ions become mobile charge carriers, which results in a decrease in the low frequency electrical resistivity of the aqueous solution, since ions move much slower in a solution than electrons move in a solid conductor. Additionally, dissolved ions, such as the nitrate ion, form physically large and concentration dependent hydration shells with water molecules. Due to their large size, these hydration shells possess a relatively low mechanical resonant frequency, which can be excited into vibration by applying RF energy at relatively low frequencies, on the order of tens of MHz&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Chighladze_2010}</cite>. This electromechanical phenomenon, known as relaxation, results in a frequency dependent complex permittivity. Other compounds, with much lower dielectric constants than water, can mix with water to alter the dielectric constant of the resulting aqueous solution. These effects cause the sensor’s impedance to be a function of both the chemistry of the solution and the excitation frequency at which the sensor’s impedance is measured.</div><h3 data-label="943515" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Measuring Impedance as a Function of Frequency</h3><div>A vector network analyzer can be used to measure impedance as a function of frequency.

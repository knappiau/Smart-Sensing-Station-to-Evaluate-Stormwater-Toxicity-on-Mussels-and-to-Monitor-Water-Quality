<h1 data-label="767280" class="ltx_title_section">Project Summary</h1><div></div><h1 data-label="196433" class="ltx_title_section">Status and Overview</h1><div>Nonpoint source pollution originating from stormwater is the  main cause of surface water degradation in  the USA&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{us-epa_assessed_2017}</cite>. Stormwater  contaminants vary depending on the land use, i.e., urban, residential, industrial,  agricultural, or forested areas. Urban land use increases impervious surfaces,  such as roads, parking lots, and rooftops. These surfaces accumulate contaminants  such as nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus), suspended solids, heavy metals (copper, zinc, lead, chromium, cadmium), and&nbsp;polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (oils, gasoline).</div><div>StormImpervious surfaces do not infiltrate stormwater and conventional  stormwater management directs contaminant-laden effluent to a storm sewer  system that discharges directly to a stream, river, or lake. Alabama’s  streams and rivers host the greatest biodiversity of freshwater mussels (~182  species)  in the world. Today, more than half of  these species are threatened and declining. Degradation of water quality and  habitat by urban use poses a major threat to remaining freshwater biodiversity  – particularly in Alabama, but in other states as well.</div><h2 data-label="608783" class="ltx_title_subsection">Stormwater Treatment with Bioretention Media</h2><div>Low impact development (LID), or green stormwater  infrastructure, involves innovative stormwater management that treats the  first, most polluted, flush of stormwater before it reaches a stream, river, or  lake. Bioretention cells, a LID stormwater control measure, have been  implemented in a small number of Alabama communities. Bioretention cells are  constructed depressions in the  landscape that capture and store stormwater for less than 48 hours (Fig. <span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{905724}</span>). The components include an underlying  specialized soil media that is specific to individual regions or states. In  Alabama, the recommended soil media is 85-88% sand, 8-12 % fines, and 3-5%  organic matter&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{dylewski_lid_2014}</cite>&nbsp;. Recommended bioretention media in other states range in sand content from 30-90% with silts, clays, organic matter, and compost being the other constituents.</div><div></div>

<div>Bioretention cells treat stormwater  and research has shown wide ranging, but generally large  (greater than 50%), reductions in concentrations of contaminants after treatment: Several authors report phosphorus removal, i.e. 60-80%&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{davis_laboratory_2001}</cite>,  &gt;&nbsp;65%&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{davis_water_2003}</cite>, 67-83%&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{chapman_performance_2010}</cite>, and 31%&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{hunt_w._f._pollutant_2008}</cite>. Phosphorus leaching (especially soluble phosphorus) appeared  to originate from fill media and surface mulch sources, especially with high  organic or compost constituents, or from other decomposing organic sources such  as grass clippings remaining in the facility&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{davis_allen_p._bioretention_2009,passeport_elodie_field_2009,hatt_hydrologic_2009}</cite>. Nitrogen reduction by bioretention cells ranged  from 1-82% for nitrate-nitrogen&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{hunt_w._f._pollutant_2008,chapman_performance_2010}</cite>&nbsp;, 2-82% for ammonia&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{davis_laboratory_2001,dietz_field_2005}</cite>&nbsp;, and 26-80% for total Kjeldahl nitrogen&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{dietz_field_2005,davis_water_2006,davis_laboratory_2001}</cite>.</div><div>Total suspended solids (TSS) reduction rates of 99, 98, 96, 92,  and 93% were reported by <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{debusk_k._m._storm-water_2011}</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{glass_evaluation_2005}</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{roseen_storm_2006}</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{g._m._rusciano_bioretention_2007}</cite>, and <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{chapman_performance_2010}</cite>, respectively. Reduction in TSS appears to be one of the most  consistently improved water quality parameters in LID bioretention treatment <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{brown_robert_a._impacts_2011}</cite>. <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{davis_allen_p._bioretention_2009}</cite>&nbsp;found heavy metals, both dissolved  and particulate-bound, were efficiently removed in bioretention facilities, and  that most of the removal occurs in the upper layers of the media <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{li_heavy_2008}</cite>.</div><div><cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{diblasi_removal_2009}</cite>&nbsp;noted that polycyclic aromatic  hydrocarbons were rapidly adsorbed and transported only a few centimeters  beneath the surface in a bioretention facility, and did not pose a hazardous  waste threat to either solid waste disposal of surface sediments or to  groundwater; use of special sorbents is unnecessary for PAHs in bioretention  facilities. Oil and grease (including motor oils) are a substantial contaminant  in road surface storm runoff. Like metals, oil and grease is removed through  bioretention facilities&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{davis_allen_p._bioretention_2009}</cite>. <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{chapman_performance_2010}</cite>&nbsp;found  consistently low minimum outflow concentrations of motor oil after treatment  through their project facility.</div><div>Although research has been conducted to evaluate nutrient  removal of bioretention cells in Alabama <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{christian_effect_2012,mark_dougherty_evaluation_2007}</cite>, there is no information on contaminants such as metals and  polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. More research on bioretention cells in  Alabama soils, climate, and stormwater is needed to evaluate the pollutant  removal effectiveness of the recommended soil media.</div><div></div><h2><b>Status of Water Quality Sensing</b></h2>

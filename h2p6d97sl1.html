Behavioral responses of bivalves can serve as a valuable early warning  system. Mussels must keep their shells open to obtain food and oxygen from the  surrounding waters.

However,  a given stressor may have a detrimental effect without causing mortality. This  is termed a sublethal effect. Sublethal effects are wide ranging and include  reduced growth and reproduction, behavioral anomalies, and altered metabolic  rates. Respiration rates of mussels and crayfish can be altered by metals and  nitrogenous wastes&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{meade_toxicity_1995,rowe_metabolic_2001,wang_metal_2005}</cite>. This in turn can strongly alter energetic budgets  of organisms&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{mueller_regulation_2011}</cite>, and lead to strong effects on scope for  growth . Jim Stoeckel is currently conducting  research to assess how thermal and chemical stressors affect metabolic patterns  of mussels. In the proposed study, we will compare effects of  treated and untreated stormwater on mussels  using a combination of  lethal effect assays focusing on mortality, and sublethal assays focusing on respiration  rates as a sensitive indicator of sublethal metabolic stress that can lead to  changes in an individual’s scope for growth. <b>We have found no research on the response of Alabama native  mussels to treated or untreated stormwater.</b></div><h2 data-label="145928" class="ltx_title_subsection"><b>Status of Water Quality Sensing</b></h2><h2 data-label="145928" class="ltx_title_subsection"></h2><h2 data-label="145928" class="ltx_title_subsection"><b>Motivation, Goals, and Objectives</b></h2><div>Today, a vast number of water quality parameters are sampled from surface waters and stormwater catchments.

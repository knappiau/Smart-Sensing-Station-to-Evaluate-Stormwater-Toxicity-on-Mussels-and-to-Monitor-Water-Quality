<div> 				Although there are many applications for environmental sensors that measure the impedance of a sample at a single frequency, additional information can sometimes be obtained by measuring the impedance at multiple frequencies or even over a wide range of frequencies. In environmental sensing applications, the sample under test is often an aqueous solution containing unknown contaminants, where it would be useful to determin</div>

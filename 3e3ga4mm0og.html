<div>Automated ISCO samplers, deployed at the site, will be used to collect time series of samples. During periods when stormwater is present, BEWS alarms will indicate the likely presence of toxicants. Samples prior to, and during BEWS alarms will be shipped to Eurofins Inc. analytical laboratories for analysis of a suite of potential toxicants.&nbsp;</div><div><b>Embedded computer system:&nbsp;</b>We will use Raspberry Pis as frameworks for our sensor system (<a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org" target="_blank">www.raspberrypi.org</a>). Raspberry Pis are economical, yet powerful and affordable micro computer systems. Recently, Raspberry Pis have been used in geosciences&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{moure_use_2015,morschhauser_low-power_2017}</cite>, automation&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{noorshams_automating_2017,todd_fully_2017}</cite>, image analysis&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{lopez-ruiz_portable_2017}</cite>, signal processing&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{pasolini_raspberry_2017}</cite>, forecasting&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{sukic_intra-minute_2017,richardson_low_2017}</cite>, as well as environmental&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{lewis_performance_2016,perri_inexpensive_2016,xu_raspberry_2016,segura-garcia_low-cost_2015,robson_making_2015,salcedo_using_2016,gurdita_simple_2016}</cite> and water quality monitoring&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{vijayakumar_real_2015,murphy_low-cost_2015,kartakis_waterbox:_2015,ibrahim_internet_2015}</cite>. Using a Raspberry Pi has many advantages over other computer or micro controller systems: They run a linux based operating system which makes it easy to implement the sensor algorithms (which were developed in objective 2) including specific R or python&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{guerra_remote_2016,obrien_harnessing_2017,noorshams_automating_2017}</cite> packages. Another advantage of the linux based operating system is that it is easy to implement a web server which means it would be possible to access the stations data directly through an internet browser. Raspberry Pis are equipped with basic I/O architecture like flash card reader, ethernet, USB, etc which lowers development costs. A powerful CPU and more RAM allow us to perform high performance computations directly on the smart sensing station.&nbsp;</div><div>The gaping behavior will be monitored with electromagnetic sensors whose data will be collected together with the water quality data by a micocontroller unit (MCU). Measurements will be transmitted in real-time either via WI-FI or cellular network to a central server. After a pilot phase we plan to implement several of these Smart Sensing Stations across the campus. That way we will be able to characterize stromwater from different locations, assess stormwater toxicity from different locations, and monitor water quality at different locations within the watershed. We will create a project website where data and analysis will be posted.</div>

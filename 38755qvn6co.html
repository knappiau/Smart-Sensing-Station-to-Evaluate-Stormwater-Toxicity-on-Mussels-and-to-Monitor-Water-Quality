<h3>Measuring Impedance as a Function of FreA vector network analyzer can be used to measure impedance as a function of frequency. This instrument will excite the unknown complex impedance&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">ZLZ_LZL</span>, with an RF sinusoidal signal at a set amplitude and frequency through a known output impedance&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">Z0Z_0Z0</span>. A real impedance of 50Ω is a typical value for&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">Z0Z_0Z0</span>. If&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">ZLZ_LZL</span>&nbsp;differs from&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">Z0Z_0Z0</span>, part of the transmitted signal will be reflected back to the transmitting instrument, with its amplitude and phase dependent on the relationship between&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">ZLZ_LZL</span> and&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">Z0Z_0Z0</span> accor<span class="math ltx_Math v1">ρ‾V=V‾rV‾i=Z‾L−Z0Z‾L+Z0\overline{\rho}_V=\frac{\overline{V}_r}{\overline{V}_i}=\frac{\overline{Z}_L-Z_0}{\overline{Z}_L+Z_0}ρV=ViVr=ZL+Z0ZL−Z0</span></h3><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><h2 data-label="161369" class="ltx_title_subsection">Objective 3:&nbsp;Implement a smart sensing station in a local watershed</h2><div>To meat our objectives we will build a Smart Sensing Station that will host mussels and different sensors, such as a toxicity sensor (to be developed in this project), and of the shelf sensors for water depth, temperature, and turbidity. A first prototype of the smart sensing station will be connected to a stormwater flume on the campus of Auburn University (Fig.&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{894273}</span>). Stormwater from this flume was found to be toxic to&nbsp;<i>Daphnia pulex&nbsp;</i>if untreated&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Kuntz:2017}</cite>. The stormwater flow will be separated and one half will be treated with the Alabama bioretention mix and the other half will remain untreated. Both flows, treated and untreated, will then be routed in separate mussel containing chambers (Symbols A and B in Fig.&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{894273}</span>). Stream water will be directed to a third chamber&nbsp;(Symbol C in Fig.&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{894273}</span>) to monitor mussel behavior when exposed to stream water only and to capture eventual contaminant plumes that are in the stream already. During dry periods, stream water will be directed to all 3 chambers (A-C) to sustain the mussels.</div><div>The gaping behavior will be monitored with electromagnetic sensors whose data will be collected together with the water quality data by a micocontroller unit (MCU). Measurements will be transmitted in real-time either via WI-FI or cellular network to a central server. After a pilot phase we plan to implement several of these Smart Sensing Stations across the campus. That way we will be able to characterize stromwater from different locations, assess stormwater toxicity from different locations, and monitor water quality at different locations within the watershed. We will create a project website where data and analysis will be posted.</div><div></div>

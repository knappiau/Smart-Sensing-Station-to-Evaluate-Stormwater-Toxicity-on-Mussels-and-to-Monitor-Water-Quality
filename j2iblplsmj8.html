<div>where G is the conductance and B is the susceptance.&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(Y_L\)</span> represents a resistance in parallel with a reactance. G can be inverted to obtain the parallel resistance value, and B can be divided by the radian frequency to obtain a parallel capacitance. By performing a frequency sweep using the network analyzer, plots of resistance and capacitance versus frequency can be obtained. Fig.&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{267818}</span>A shows the capacitance of different liquids, such as swater, tap water, DI water, and water containing different forms of nitrogen. In a preliminary test, we added copper and zinc at concentrations similar to those found in stormwater leading to different results in the capacitance curve (Fig.&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{267818}</span>B). These results indicate, that it is possible to sense typical stormwater contaminants with this proposed sensor.</div><div></div><div></div>

<h3 data-label="632688" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Phase 2</h3><div>Stormwater will be collected from the outflows of the untreated and treated BEWS during storms that do, and do not set off alarms and stored in amber glass bottles frozen at -20C. Frozen stormwater has been shown to retain its toxicity for at least 2 months following collection <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{mcintyre_zebrafish_2014}</cite>. Within 2 months of collection, samples will be thawed and mussels exposed to untreated and treated storm water to determine the degree to which treatment ameliorates lethal and sublethal effects.</div><div><b>Lethal effects: </b>Treated and untreated stormwater will be thawed and 500 ml poured into glass beakers for a total of three replicate beakers per treatment. An additional three beakers will be filled with 500 ml of reconstituted freshwater as a control. Ten mussels will be placed in each beaker with light aeration and held at the original stormwater collection temperature for 48 hours. At the end of that period, mortality will be recorded and differences in mortality among treatments  will be tested. </div><div><b>Sublethal effects:&nbsp;</b>Stormwater contaminants may not always cause mortality within
48 hours, but may still stress or harm aquatic organisms - resulting in sublethal effects. Respirometry is one accepted method to determine sublethal effects&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{chen_comparison_2001,mueller_regulation_2011}</cite>. Stormwater contaminants, including nitrogen compounds and metals, affect oxygen consumption patterns of crayfish and mussels&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{meade_toxicity_1995,ahern_respiratory_1999,rowe_metabolic_2001,wang_metal_2005,khan_effect_2006,zhao_environmental_2014}</cite>. These patterns reflect various physiological functions andcharacteristics, including respiration rate, ability to obtain sufficient oxygen under changing conditions, and hypoxia tolerance.
Following standard closed respirometry protocols (e.g.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citealp{chen_comparison_2001,mueller_regulation_2011}</cite>), mussels and crayfish will be starved for 24 hours and then transferred to individual respirometry chambers (four channel, fiber optic respirometry system; Loligo Inc.). Following a 12-hour acclimation period, flow through each chamber will be shut off and respiration rate will be calculated every 3-6 minutes until dissolved oxygen (DO) declines to
&lt; 1 mg/L. Data will be analyzed following the methodology of&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{mueller_regulation_2011}</cite>&nbsp; to determine respiration rates, ability to regulate oxygen consumption (RI: a measure of the ability of organisms to maintain a constant respiration rate), and critical dissolved oxygen concentration (DOcrit: a measure of the dissolved oxygen threshold below which severe stress and ultimately death is expected). Results will show whether untreated stormwater exhibited sublethal toxicity and whether bioretention soils were able to reduce or eliminate sublethal toxicity.

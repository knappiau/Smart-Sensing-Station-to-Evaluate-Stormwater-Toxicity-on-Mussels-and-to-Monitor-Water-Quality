Frozen stormwater has been shown to retain its toxicity for at least 2 months following collection <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{mcintyre_zebrafish_2014}</cite>. Within 2 months of collection, samples will be thawed and mussels exposed to untreated and treated storm water to determine the degree to which treatment ameliorates lethal and sublethal effects.</div><div><b>Lethal effects: </b>Treated and untreated stormwater will be thawed and 500 ml poured into glass beakers for a total of three replicate beakers per treatment. An additional three beakers will be filled with 500 ml of reconstituted freshwater as a control. Ten mussels will be placed in each beaker with light aeration and held at the original stormwater collection temperature for 48 hours. At the end of that period, mortality will be recorded and differences in mortality among treatments  will be tested. </div><div><b>Sublethal effects:&nbsp;</b>Stormwater contaminants may not always cause mortality within
48 hours, but may still stress or harm aquatic organisms - resulting in sublethal effects. Respirometry is one accepted method to determine sublethal effects&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{chen_comparison_2001,mueller_regulation_2011}</cite>. Stormwater contaminants, including nitrogen compounds and metals, affect oxygen consumption patterns of crayfish and mussels&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{meade_toxicity_1995,ahern_respiratory_1999,rowe_metabolic_2001,wang_metal_2005,khan_effect_2006,zhao_environmental_2014}</cite>. These patterns reflect various physiological functions andcharacteristics, including respiration rate, ability to obtain sufficient oxygen under changing conditions, and hypoxia tolerance.
Following standard closed respirometry protocols (e.g. <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citealp{chen_comparison_2001,mueller_regulation_2011}</cite>), mussels and crayfish will be starved for 24 hours and then transferred to individual respirometry chambers (four channel, fiber optic respirometry system; Loligo Inc.). Following a 12-hour acclimation period, flow through each chamber will be shut off and respiration rate will be calculated every 3-6 minutes until dissolved oxygen (DO) declines to
&lt; 1 mg/L <b>(see Figure 2 for example of data output)</b>. Data will be analyzed following the methodology of <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{mueller_regulation_2011}</cite>&nbsp; to determine respiration rates, ability to regulate oxygen consumption (RI: a measure of the ability of organisms to maintain a constant respiration rate), and critical dissolved oxygen concentration (DOcrit: a measure of the dissolved oxygen threshold below which severe stress and ultimately death is expected). Results will show whether untreated stormwater exhibited sublethal toxicity and whether bioretention soils were able to reduce or eliminate sublethal toxicity.

The non-conductive FR-4 substrate forms a rigid backbone for the sensing element. The patterned Cu cladding is used for sensing electrodes and signal traces. The polymeric solder mask serves as a thin insulating and moisture barrier layer. Four electrodes covered with solder mask are on the top side, where the solder mask electrically insulates them from the sensing environment. These electrodes can be used to measure the electrical permittivity or the electrical permeability of the surrounding media. Two exposed electrodes are shown on the bottom side which can be used to measure the resistance and therefore the electrical conductivity of the surrounding media. Through measuring these electrical properties of the surrounding environment, useful information about the environment can be ascertained, such as salinity&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Dean_2016}</cite>, soil moisture content&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Dean_2010}</cite>, nitrate concentration&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Yunus_2011}</cite>, pH&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Zoolfakar_2010}</cite>, water supply contamination&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Amri_Md_Yunus_2015}</cite>,and the mass of a drop of water <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Meng_2016}</cite>.&nbsp;</div><h3 data-label="249968" class="ltx_title_subsubsection"><span>Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy&nbsp;</span></h3><div> 				Although there are many applications for environmental sensors that measure the impedance of a sample at a single frequency, additional information can sometimes be obtained by measuring the impedance at multiple frequencies or even over a wide range of frequencies. In environmental sensing applications, the sample under test is often an aqueous solution containing unknown contaminants, where it would be useful to determine what the contaminants are. Some chemicals that dissolve in or mix with water not only change the electrical properties of the water, but also change the electrical properties as a function of frequency, thereby creating an impedance versus frequency signature that can sometimes be used to identify the chemicals present in the aqueous solution. This type of analysis is called electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).</div><div>Water is one of the most studied compounds. It is a polar molecule with an electrical resistivity of approximately 18.18 MΩ-cm at 25C&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Light_2005}</cite>, and a relative permittivity of approximately 78.3 at 25oC&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Schwan_1976}</cite>. The electrical properties of water are temperature dependent&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Malmberg_1956}</cite>. When an ionic compound dissolves in water, the ions become mobile charge carriers, which results in a decrease in the low frequency electrical resistivity of the aqueous solution, since ions move much slower in a solution than electrons move in a solid conductor. Additionally, dissolved ions, such as the nitrate ion, form physically large and concentration dependent hydration shells with water molecules. Due to their large size, these hydration shells possess a relatively low mechanical resonant frequency, which can be excited into vibration by applying RF energy at relatively low frequencies, on the order of tens of MHz&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Chighladze_2010}</cite>. This electromechanical phenomenon, known as relaxation, results in a frequency dependent complex permittivity. Other compounds, with much lower dielectric constants than water, can mix with water to alter the dielectric constant of the resulting aqueous solution. These effects cause the sensor’s impedance to be a function of both the chemistry of the solution and the excitation frequency at which the sensor’s impedance is measured.</div><h3 data-label="943515" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Measuring Impedance as a Function of Frequency</h3><div>A vector network analyzer can be used to measure impedance as a function of frequency.

The Alabama Cooperative Extension System (ACES) Water Resources Program &nbsp;in partnership with the project investigators has a strong program to provide science-based education on innovative stormwater management that includes the development of a Low Impact Development Handbook for Alabama, technical trainings for stormwater control measure design, implementation and maintenance, and a robust outreach program to the general public that works closely with Master Gardeners and homeowner stewardship responsibilities using Alabama Smart Yards manual and app.</div><div>Project investigators  work closely with stormwater professionals in Alabama for input and guidance on information needed to  improve water resources management. The ACES Water Resources Program has direct and frequent interactions with stormwater decision makers. We have &nbsp;conducted three statewide stormwater forums in 2014, 2016 and 2017 to bring together &nbsp;local and state government representatives, researchers, private industry, and concerned citizens. Each stormwater forum had over 100 participants and future stormwater forums will include research results from this project. We are also on the leadership planning team for a statewide stormwater association that meets 4 times a year to discuss current needs and identify future plans. Through these two organizations, we have the ability to reach entities that have direct management responsibilities for improved stormwater management in Alabama at the local and statewide level.</div><div>A common concern of &nbsp;local and state government employees is elected officials' lack of awareness of the connection between land use decisions and stormwater / water quality impacts. Further, recurring education is required as there is frequent turnover of elected officials. The ACES Water Program  provided water resources training in 2016 and 2017 to city councilmen and mayors  attending the Alabama League of Municipalities statewide events. Our programs were well received and we've been invited to future events. Participation in League of Municipalities continuing education events  provides an avenue to share implications of stormwater pollution, research results, and requests for future needs.</div><div>In Alabama, 4th grade students in 25 of  67 counties participate in Groundwater Festivals sponsored by city and county governments and the Alabama Department of Environmental Management. The Groundwater Festivals are hands-on demonstrations of the importance of water, impacts to water quality (especially non point source pollution), and simple strategies to protect water. Project investigators have worked closely with the Lee County Groundwater Festival planning and implementation. We also have a close relationship with the Alabama Department of Envrionmental Management's Nonpoint Source Division that assists in statewide coordination of Groundwater Festivals. We propose to refine curriculum content for the "Water Filtration" activity to include impacts of stormwater pollutants on aquatic biota.

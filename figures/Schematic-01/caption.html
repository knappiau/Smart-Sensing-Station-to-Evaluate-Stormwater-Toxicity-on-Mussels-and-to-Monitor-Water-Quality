<div data-label="894273">The Smart Sensing Station will be operated in two modes: 1. During a storm, stormwater will runoff and enter the station through the flume. One half will be treated with bioretention mix, the other half will enter the station untreated. The station is separated in 3 chambers: mussels exposed to untreated stormwater (A), treated stormwater (B), and stream water (C). 2. During dry periods, stream water is routed to all 3 chambers to sustain the mussel population. Gaping behavior is recored by the raspberry piand submitted to a central server together with data from the toxicity sensors (S).</div>

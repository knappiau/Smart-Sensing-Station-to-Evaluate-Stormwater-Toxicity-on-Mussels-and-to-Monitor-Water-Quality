Red circles indicate locations of other stormwater flumes were further Smart Sensing Stations could be implemented. A schematic of a&nbsp;Smart Sensing Station network is shown in&nbsp;<b>(B)</b>. Time series data from several locations in the watershed will allow to understand the contaminant dynamics in a urban stream. Shifts in time series data will be analyzed with wavelets <b>(C)</b>.</div>

<div>Stormwater does not infiltrate impervious surfaces and conventional  stormwater management directs contaminant-laden effluent to a storm sewer  system that discharges directly to a stream, river, or lake. Alabama’s  streams and rivers host the greatest biodiversity of freshwater mussels (~182  species)  in the world. Today, more than half of  these species are threatened and declining. Degradation of water quality and  habitat by urban use poses a major threat to remaining freshwater biodiversity  – particularly in Alabama, but in other states as well.</div><h2>Stormwater Effects on Aquatic Organisms</h2>

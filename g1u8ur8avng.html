<div>A vector network analyzer can be used to measure impedance as a function of frequency. This instrument will excite the unknown complex impedance&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">ZLZ_LZL</span>, with an RF sinusoidal signal at a set amplitude and frequency through a known output impedance&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">Z0Z_0Z0</span>. A real impedance of 50Ω is a typical value for&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">Z0Z_0Z0</span>. If&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">ZLZ_LZL</span>&nbsp;differs from&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">Z0Z_0Z0</span>, part of the transmitted signal will be reflected back to the transmitting instrument, with its amplitude and phase dependent on the relationship between&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">ZLZ_LZL</span> and&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">Z0Z_0Z0</span> according to:&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">ρ‾V=V‾rV‾i=Z‾L−Z0Z‾L+Z0\overline{\rho}_V=\frac{\overline{V}_r}{\overline{V}_i}=\frac{\overline{Z}_L-Z_0}{\overline{Z}_L+Z_0}ρV=ViVr=ZL+Z0ZL−Z0</span></div>

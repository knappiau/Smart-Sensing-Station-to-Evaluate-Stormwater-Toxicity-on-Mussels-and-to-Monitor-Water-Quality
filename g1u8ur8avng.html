<div>A vector network analyzer can be used to measure impedance as a function of frequency. This instrument will excite the unknown complex impedance&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">ZLZ_LZL</span>, with an RF sinusoidal signal at a set amplitude and frequency through a known output impedance&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">Z0Z_0Z0</span>. A real impedance of 50Ω is a typical value for&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">Z0Z_0Z0</span>. If&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">ZLZ_LZL</span>&nbsp;differs from&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">Z0Z_0Z0</span>, part of the transmitted signal will be reflected back to the transmitting instrument, with its amplitude and phase dependent on the relationship between&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">ZLZ_LZL</span> and&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">Z0Z_0Z0</span> according to:&nbsp;</div><div>ρV=ViVr=ZL+Z0ZL−Z0&nbsp;</div>

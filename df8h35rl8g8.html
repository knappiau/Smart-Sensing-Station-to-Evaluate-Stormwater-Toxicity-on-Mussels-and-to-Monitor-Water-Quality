<div>Stormwater runoff  transports  contaminants to receiving waters, many of which are toxic to fish&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{skinner_developmental_1999,kayhanian_toxicity_2008,corsi_fresh_2010}</cite>, invertebrates&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{hall_toxicity_1988,marsalek_exploratory_1999,kayhanian_toxicity_2008,corsi_fresh_2010}</cite>, and aquatic plants&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{kayhanian_toxicity_2008}</cite>. In the western U.S.,  research on coho salmon (<i>Oncorhynchus  kisutch</i>), daphnia (<i>Ceriodaphnia dubia</i>),  mayfly (<i>Baetis spp</i>.), and zebra fish  (<i>Danio rerio</i>), that were exposed to  untreated stormwater, revealed devastating lethal and sublethal effects on these  organisms&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{mcintyre_zebrafish_2014,mcintyre_soil_2015,spromberg_coho_2016}</cite>. Untreated runoff caused heart failure, delayed hatching, reduced growth,  pericardial edema, microphthalmia (small eyes), and reduced swim bladder  inflation in zebra fish&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{mcintyre_zebrafish_2014}</cite>. Untreated stormwater runoff  was generally lethal to salmon and invertebrates and sublethal reproductive  toxicity was detected in daphnia&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{mcintyre_soil_2015}</cite>. Untreated stormwater runoff  collected during nine storms was universally lethal to adult coho salmon <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{spromberg_coho_2016}</cite>.</div>

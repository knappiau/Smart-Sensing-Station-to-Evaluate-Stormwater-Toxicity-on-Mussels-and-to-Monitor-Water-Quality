  abstract = {Prompt detection of intentional or accidental contamination of the public water supply is vital to maintain public health in any centralized water distribution system. Being able to quickly detect a system contamination event may be the single most influential factor to reduce possible contamination fallout. Consequently, major research has explored how to best protect a water distribution system (WDS) through strategic placement of fixed water quality monitoring stations. Although fixed monitoring stations within a wireless sensor network (WSN) are robust with respect to hydraulic conditions, the stations are expensive to place, and may not provide the highest spatial and temporal resolution of contamination detection. This work sets to build the understanding of a mobile wireless sensor network (MWSN) where inline mobile sensors function within water in pipes to monitor water quality and to wirelessly transmit data to fixed transceivers in real time. Mobile sensor behavior was modeled alongside contamination simulations and the deployment of fixed and mobile sensors was together optimized to minimize the affected population prior contamination event detection constrained by a total system cost. Results show a MWSN to be highly sensitive to sensor battery life, transceiver network coverage, and total system cost. Future obstacles for implementation of a MWSN are highlighted and discussed to be address in future work. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

The network may become pressure-deficient owing to continued use of water distribution network beyond its design life. The two objectives are combined using weights. Genetic algorithm is used to obtain optimum sensor locations. The methodology is applied to a pressure-deficient network in the Dharampeth zone of Nagpur city (India). The pressure-dependent analysis is carried out using WaterGem v8i to simulate the system hydraulics. Performance objectives are evaluated considering the availability of flows at nodes and velocity of flow in pipes under pressure-deficient conditions.

Second, sensor locations are optimized for minimizing the contaminant intrusion detection time using the travel time matrix and the Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA). These methods were applied to two water distribution networks. It was found that the BC method generates optimal locations close to the water sources and the water main, whereas the MOGA-based method generates optimal sensor locations far away from the sources. These results support the following conclusions. First, the installation priority of gauges can be determined with a more objective standard using the aforementioned two methods. Second, given specific objectives, the two models can be used as alternative decision-making tools for sensor installation.},

  abstract = {Placement of water quality sensors in a water distribution system is a common approach for minimizing contamination intrusion risks. This study incorporates detailed chemistry of organophosphate contaminations into the problem of sensor placement and links quantitative measures of the affected population as a result of such intrusions. The suggested methodology utilizes the stoichiometry and kinetics of the reactions between organophosphate contaminants and free chlorine for predicting the number of affected consumers. This is accomplished through linking a multi-species water quality model and a statistical dose response model. Three organophosphates (chlorpyrifos, malathion, and parathion) are tested as possible contaminants. Their corresponding by-products were modeled and accounted for in the affected consumers impact calculations. The methodology incorporates a series of randomly generated intrusion events linked to a genetic algorithm for minimizing the contaminants impact through a sensors system. Three example applications are explored for demonstrating the model capabilities through base runs and sensitivity analyses. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Eagle Creek, Morse and Geist reservoirs, drinking water supply sources for the Indianapolis, Indiana, USA metropolitan region, are experiencing nuisance cyanobacterial blooms. Hyperspectral remote sensing has been proven to be an effective tool for phycocyanin (C-PC) concentration retrieval, a proxy pigment unique to cyanobacteria in freshwater ecosystems. An adaptive model based on genetic algorithm and partial least squares (GA-PLS), together with three-band algorithm (TBA) and other band ratio algorithms were applied to hyperspectral data acquired from in situ (ASD spectrometer) and airborne (AISA sensor) platforms. The results indicated that GA-PLS achieved high correlation between measured and estimated C-PC for GR (RMSE=16.3 mu g/L, RMSE\%=18.2; range (R): 2.6-185.1 mu g/L), MR (RMSE=8.7 mu g/L, RMSE\%=15.6; R: 3.3-371.0 mu g/L) and ECR (RMSE=19.3 mu g/L, RMSE\%=26.4; R: 0.7-245.0 mu g/L) for the in situ datasets. TBA also performed well compared to other band ratio algorithms due to its optimal band tuning process and the reduction of backscattering effects through the third band. GA-PLS (GR: RMSE=24.1 mu g/L, RMSE\%=25.2, R: 25.2-185.1 mu g/L; MR: RMSE=15.7 mu g/L, RMSE\%=37.4, R: 2.0-135.1 mu g/L) and TBA (GR: RMSE=28.3 mu g/L, RMSE\%=30.1; MR: RMSE=17.7 mu g/L, RMSE\%=41.9) methods results in somewhat lower accuracy using AISA imagery data, which is likely due to atmospheric correction or radiometric resolution. GA-PLS (TBA) obtained an RMSE of 24.82 mu g/L (35.8 mu g/L), and RMSE\% of 31.24 (43.5) between measured and estimated C-PC for aggregated datasets. C-PC maps were generated through GA-PLS using AISA imagery data. The C-PC concentration had an average value of 67.31 +/- 44.23 mu g/L in MR with a large range of concentration, while the GR had a higher average value 103.17 +/- 33.45 mu g/L.

  abstract = {Intense demand for water in the Central Valley of California and related increases in groundwater nitrate concentration threaten the sustainability of the groundwater resource. To assess contamination risk in the region, we developed a hybrid, non-linear, machine learningmodel within a statistical learning framework to predict nitrate contamination of groundwater to depths of approximately 500 m below ground surface. A database of 145 predictor variables representing well characteristics, historical and current field and landscape-scale nitrogen mass balances, historical and current land use, oxidation/reduction conditions, groundwater flow, climate, soil characteristics, depth to groundwater, and groundwater age were assigned to over 6000 private supply and public supply wells measured previously for nitrate and located throughout the study area. The boosted regression tree (BRT) method was used to screen and rank variables to predict nitrate concentration at the depths of domestic and public well supplies. The novel approach included as predictor variables outputs from existing physically based models of the Central Valley. The top five most important predictor variables included two oxidation/reduction variables (probability of manganese concentration to exceed 50 ppb and probability of dissolved oxygen concentration to be below 0.5 ppm), field-scale adjusted unsaturated zone nitrogen input for the 1975 time period, average difference between precipitation and evapotranspiration during the years 1971-2000, and 1992 total landscape nitrogen input. Twenty-five variables were selected for the final model for log-transformed nitrate. In general, increasing probability of anoxic conditions and increasing precipitation relative to potential evapotranspiration had a corresponding decrease in nitrate concentration predictions. Conversely, increasing 1975 unsaturated zone nitrogen leaching flux and 1992 total landscape nitrogen input had an increasing relative impact on nitrate predictions. Three-dimensional visualization indicates that nitrate predictions depend on the probability of anoxic conditions and other factors, and that nitrate predictions generally decreased with increasing groundwater age.

This study develops a remote sensing-based multiscale modeling system by integrating multi-sensor satellite data merging and image reconstruction algorithms in support of feature extraction with machine learning leading to automate continuous water quality monitoring in environmentally sensitive regions. This new Earth observation platform, termed cross mission data merging and image reconstruction with machine learning (CDMIM), is capable of merging multiple satellite imageries to provide daily water quality monitoring through a series of image processing, enhancement, reconstruction, and data mining/machine learning techniques. Two existing key algorithms, including Spectral Information Adaptation and Synthesis Scheme (SIASS) and SMart Information Reconstruction (SMIR), are highlighted to support feature extraction and content-based. mapping. Whereas SIASS can support various data merging efforts to merge images collected from cross-mission satellite sensors, SMIR can overcome data gaps by reconstructing the information of value-missing pixels due to impacts such as cloud obstruction. Practical implementation of CDMIM was assessed by predicting the water quality over seasons in terms of the concentrations of nutrients and chlorophyll-a, as well as water clarity in Lake Nicaragua, providing synergistic efforts to better monitor the aquatic environment and offer insightful lake watershed management strategies.

Traditionally, marine biomonitoring involves the sorting and morphological identification of benthic macro invertebrates, which is time-consuming and taxonomic expertise demanding. High-throughput amplicon sequencing of environmental DNA (eDNA metabarcoding) represents a promising alternative for benthic monitoring. However, an important fraction of eDNA sequences remains unassigned or belong to taxa of unknown ecology, which prevent their use for assessing the ecological quality status. Here, we show that supervised machine learning (SML) can be used to build robust predictive models for benthic monitoring, regardless of the taxonomic assignment of eDNA sequences. We tested three SML approaches to assess the environmental impact of marine aquaculture using benthic foraminifera eDNA, a group of unicellular eukaryotes known to be good bioindicators, as features to infer macro-invertebrates based biotic indices. We found similar ecological status as obtained from macro-invertebrates inventories. We argue that SML approaches could overcome and even bypass the cost and time-demanding morpho-taxonomic approaches in future biomonitoring.},

Although these gases are usually safe for humans, they could be hazardous if their amount exceeded certain limits of exposure for human health. A sophisticated indoor air quality (IAQ) monitoring system which could classify the specific type of pollutants is very helpful. This study proposes an enhanced indoor air quality monitoring system (IAQMS) which could recognize the pollutants by utilizing supervised machine learning algorithms: multilayer perceptron (MLP), K-nearest neighbour (KNN) and linear discrimination analysis (LDA). Five sources of indoor air pollutants have been tested: ambient air, combustion activity, presence of chemicals, presence of fragrances and presence of food and beverages. The results showed that the three algorithms successfully classify the five sources of indoor air pollution (IAP) with a classification rate of up to 100 percent. An MLP classifier with a model structure of 9-3-5 has been chosen to be embedded into the IAQMS. The system has also been tested with all sources of IAP presented together. The result shows that the system is able to classify when single and two mixed sources are presented together. However, when more than two sources of IAP are presented at the same period, the system will classify the sources as 'unknown', because the system cannot recognize the input of the new pattern.},

  abstract = {Giardia lamblia is a waterborne parasite that affects millions of people every year worldwide, causing a diarrheal illness known as giardiasis. Timely detection of the presence of the cysts of this parasite in drinking water is important to prevent the spread of the disease, especially in resource-limited settings. Here we provide extended experimental testing and evaluation of the performance and repeatability of a field-portable and cost-effective microscopy platform for automated detection and counting of Giardia cysts in water samples, including tap water, non-potable water, and pond water. This compact platform is based on our previous work, and is composed of a smartphone-based fluorescence microscope, a disposable sample processing cassette, and a custom-developed smartphone application. Our mobile phone microscope has a large field of view of similar to 0.8 cm(2) and weighs only similar to 180 g, excluding the phone. A custom-developed smartphone application provides a user-friendly graphical interface, guiding the users to capture a fluorescence image of the sample filter membrane and analyze it automatically at our servers using an image processing algorithm and training data, consisting of {\textgreater} 30,000 images of cysts and {\textgreater} 100,000 images of other fluorescent particles that are captured, including, e.g. dust. The total time that it takes from sample preparation to automated cyst counting is less than an hour for each 10 ml of water sample that is tested. We compared the sensitivity and the specificity of our platform using multiple supervised classification models, including support vector machines and nearest neighbors, and demonstrated that a bootstrap aggregating (i.e. bagging) approach using raw image file format provides the best performance for automated detection of Giardia cysts. We evaluated the performance of this machine learning enabled pathogen detection device with water samples taken from different sources (e.g. tap water, non-potable water, pond water) and achieved a limit of detection of 12 cysts per 10 ml, an average cyst capture efficiency of similar to 79\%, and an accuracy of similar to 95\%. Providing rapid detection and quantification of waterborne pathogens without the need for a microbiology expert, this field-portable imaging and sensing platform running on a smartphone could be very useful for water quality monitoring in resource-limited settings.},

The choice of suitable treatment technologies is dependent on the pollutant concentrations.

The aim of this study is to provide an indirect methodology for the estimation of the main wastewater quality indicators, based on some characteristics of the drainage basin. The catchment is seen as a black box: the physical processes of accumulation, washing, and transport of pollutants are not mathematically described.Two models deriving from studies on artificial intelligence have been used in this research: Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Regression Trees (RT). Both the models showed robustness, reliability, and high generalization capability. However, with reference to coefficient of determination R-2 and root-mean square error, Support Vector Regression showed a better performance than Regression Tree in predicting TSS, TDS, and COD. As regards BOD5, the two models showed a comparable performance. Therefore, the considered machine learning algorithms may be useful for providing an estimation of the values to be considered for the sizing of the treatment units in absence of direct measures.},

  abstract = {A team of leading United Kingdom (UK) space companies, in collaboration with the Raspberry Pi Foundation (RPF), created the Astro Pi project (www.astro-pi.org) in order to exploit the outreach possibilities offered by the flight of British European Space Agency (ESA) astronaut Tim Peake to the International Space Station (ISS) between December 2015 and June 2016. At the core of the project is the Astro Pi payload, which was developed to be taken to the ISS and into classrooms. It consists of a Raspberry Pi B+ computer, an add-on board called the Sense Hardware Attached on Top (HAT), a camera, a joystick, and six push buttons. The Sense HAT board was designed to host a range of sensors and input/output devices to be used for experiments aboard the ISS and in the classroom. The payload was qualified for spaceflight in 2015, and a competition was run to promote engagement between schools and the UK space industry that was supported by a range of learning resources. The payload was launched into space on the Orbital Sciences OA-4 Cygnus cargo freighter in December 2015, and the winning experiments were run on the ISS by Tim Peake in early 2016. These generated a range of data for analysis on the ground. Between February and March 2016, a second competition was run. In both competitions, the prize was to have students' code uploaded and run on the Astro Pi payload by Tim Peake. This paper is divided into four sections. The first provides details of the Cygnus launch and flight operations aboard the ISS. The second reviews the results of the first competition, and how these were distributed and analysed by the schools. The third covers the second competition including its results, impact, and engagement. The fourth details ongoing outreach, events, and the establishment of a long-term legacy for Astro Pi. This paper continues the work in the 2015 paper ASTRO PI: LAUNCH YOUR CODE INTO SPACE (IAC-15-E1.2.1); readers may consult the original paper for context first.},

  abstract = {The European Commission has explained how heating and cooling in buildings and industry account for half of the energy consumption of the EU. Several studies explain how to achieve an energy saving at home, and the use of smart thermostats will help to reduce energy consumption while increasing the efficiency of households. In this article, a comparative evaluation was carried out between four smart thermostats that are now on the market, whose characteristics vary in terms of price, precision of measurements and set temperature, algorithms, etc. A thermal test chamber was designed and constructed from a refrigerator, a thermal blanket, a Raspberry Pi and the necessary electronic components for its control and data collection. From the tests carried out in the thermal chamber, data on the operation of the four thermostats such as the maintenance and the anticipation of the setpoint temperature, were obtained. It was necessary to run the system enough times for each thermostat to memorize the housing characteristics, such as its inertia and its thermal insulation. This would also allow for the generation of a better algorithm to regulate the temperature, which would create a lower oscillation with respect to the setpoint temperature. The learning of the thermostats was not demonstrated and for the anticipation mode it was seen that the thermostats failed to improve or learn in this aspect, as they did not improve the start-up times of the heating system, with the consequent increase in energy consumption.},

  abstract = {Zebrafish animal models lend themselves to behavioral assays that can facilitate rapid screening of ototoxic, otoprotective, and otoregenerative drugs. Structurally similar to human inner ear hair cells, the mechanosensory hair cells on their lateral line allow the zebrafish to sense water flow and orient head-to-current in a behavior called rheotaxis. This rheotaxis behavior deteriorates in a dose-dependent manner with increased exposure to the ototoxin cisplatin, thereby establishing itself as an excellent biomarker for anatomic damage to lateral line hair cells. Building on work by our group and others, we have built a new, fully automated high-throughput behavioral assay system that uses automated image analysis techniques to quantify rheotaxis behavior. This novel system consists of a custom-designed swimming apparatus and imaging system consisting of network-controlled Raspberry Pi microcomputers capturing infrared video. Automated analysis techniques detect individual zebrafish, compute their orientation, and quantify the rheotaxis behavior of a zebrafish test population, producing a powerful, high-throughput behavioral assay. Using our fully automated biological assay to test a standardized ototoxic dose of cisplatin against varying doses of compounds that protect or regenerate hair cells may facilitate rapid translation of candidate drugs into preclinical mammalian models of hearing loss.},

  abstract = {Background: Operant training systems make use of water or food restriction and make it necessary to weigh animals to ensure compliance with experimental endpoints. In other applications periodic weighing is necessary to assess drug side-effects, or as an endpoint in feeding experiments. Periodic weighing while essential can disrupt animal circadian rhythms and social structure. New method: Automatic weighing system within paired mouse homecages. Up to 10 mice freely move between two cages (28 x 18 x 9 cm) which were connected by a weighing chamber mounted on a load cell. Each mouse was identified using an RFID tag placed under the skin of the neck. A single-board computer (Raspberry Pi; RPi) controls the task, logging RFID tag, load cell weights, and time stamps from each RFID detection until the animal leaves the chamber. Collected data were statistically analyzed to estimate mouse weights. We anticipate integration with tasks where automated imaging or behaviour is assessed in homecages. Results: Mice frequently move between the two cages, an average of 42+-16 times/day/mouse at which time we obtained weights. We report accurate determination of mouse weight and long term monitoring over 53 days. Comparison with existing methods Although commercial systems are available for automatically weighing rodents, they only work with single animals, or are not open source nor cost effective for specific custom application. Conclusions: This automated system permits automated weighing of mice 40 times per day. The system employs inexpensive hardware and open-source Python code. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

These effects can be reduced effectively by proper short-term cloud passing forecasting and suitable PV power plant output power control. This paper proposes a low-cost Internet of Things (IoT)-based solution for intra-minute cloud passing forecasting. The hardware consists of a Raspberry PI Model B 3 with a WiFi connection and an OmniVision OV5647 sensor with a mounted wide-angle lens, a circular polarizing (CPL) filter and a natural density (ND) filter. The completely new algorithm for cloud passing forecasting uses the green and blue colors in the photo to determine the position of the Sun, to recognize the clouds, and to predict their movement. The image processing is performed in several stages, considering selectively only a small part of the photo relevant to the movement of the clouds in the vicinity of the Sun in the next minute. The proposed algorithm is compact, fast and suitable for implementation on low cost processors with low computation power. The speed of the cloud parts closest to the Sun is used to predict when the clouds will cover the Sun. WiFi communication is used to transmit this data to the PV power plant control system in order to decrease the output power slowly and smoothly.},

  abstract = {The objective of this research work is to propose a weed detecting robotic model for sugarcane fields that uses a fuzzy real time classifier on leaf textures. The differentiation between weed and crop and weed removal are the two challenging tasks for the farmers especially in the Indian sugarcane cultivation scenario. The automatic weed detection and removal becomes a vital task for improving the cost effectiveness and efficiency of the agricultural processes. The detection of weeds by the robotic model employs a Raspberry Pi based control system placed in a moving vehicle. An automated image classification system has been designed which extracts leaf textures and employs a fuzzy real-time classification technique. Morphological operators are applied to extract circular leaf patterns in different scales from the leaf images. An optimal set of features have been identified for the characterization of crops and weeds in sugarcane fields. A weed detecting robotic prototype is designed and developed using a Raspberry Pi micro controller and suitable input output subsystems such as cameras, small light sources and motors with power systems. The prototype's control incorporates the weed detection mechanism using a Raspbian operating system support and python programming. The designed robotic prototype correctly identifies the sugarcane crop among nine different weed species. The system detects weeds with 92.9\% accuracy over a processing time of 0.02 s.

Users of these units are, however, often frustrated by the limited options for controlling camera functions, the generation of large numbers of images, and the lack of flexibility to suit different research environments and questions. We describe the development of a user-customisable open source camera trap platform named 'WiseEye', designed to provide flexible camera trap technology for wildlife researchers. The novel platform is based on a Raspberry Pi single-board computer and compatible peripherals that allow the user to control its functions and performance. We introduce the concept of confirmatory sensing, in which the Passive Infrared triggering is confirmed through other modalities (i.e. radar, pixel change) to reduce the occurrence of false positives images. This concept, together with user-definable meta-data, aided identification of spurious images and greatly reduced post-collection processing time. When tested against a commercial camera trap, WiseEye was found to reduce the incidence of false positive images and false negatives across a range of test conditions. WiseEye represents a step-change in camera trap functionality, greatly increasing the value of this technology for wildlife research and conservation management.},

The developed system provides information that can be used for a fast in situ identification and classification of samples based on the analysis of captured images. The connectivity of the instrument allows a deeper analysis of the images in an external computer. Design/methodology/approach The wavelength selection of the system is carried out by light multiplexing through a light-emitting diode panel where eight wavelengths covering the spectrum from ultraviolet (UV) to near-infrared region (NIR) have been included. The image sensor used is a red green blue - infrared (RGB-IR) micro-camera controlled by a Raspberry Pi board where a basic image processing algorithm has been programmed. It allows the visualization in an integrated display of the reflectance and the histogram of the images at each wavelength, including UV and NIRs. Findings The prototype has been tested by analyzing several samples in a variety of applications such as detection of damaged, over-ripe and sprayed fruit, classification of different type of plastic materials and determination of properties of water. Originality/value The designed system presents some advantages as being non-expensive and portable in comparison to other multispectral imaging systems.

Experiments were then conducted to explore the instrumental capabilities while, at the same time, using Python programming to plot data, perform linear least-squares fitting, and calculate errors. Instrument response and spectral measurements were followed by kinetic studies, enabling the students to tackle a real problem by extracting rate constants. The main learning outcomes were that the students would gain a better understanding of instrumental components and at the same time learn valuable analytical techniques such as calibration, determination of the limits of linearity, and dynamic range.

Often the data require real-time processing to support high system responsiveness which can be supported by localised Cloud and/or Fog computing paradigms. However, there are considerably large deployments of IoT such as sensor networks in remote areas where Internet connectivity is sparse, challenging the localised Cloud and/or Fog computing paradigms. With the advent of the Raspberry Pi, a credit card-sized single board computer, there is a great opportunity to construct low-cost, low-power portable cloud to support real-time data processing next to IoT deployments. In this paper, we extend our previous work on constructing Raspberry Pi Cloud to study its feasibility for real-time big data analytics under realistic application-level workload in both native and virtualised environments. We have extensively tested the performance of a single node Raspberry Pi 2 Model B with httperf and a cluster of 12 nodes with Apache Spark and HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System). Our results have demonstrated that our portable cloud is useful for supporting real-time big data analytics. On the other hand, our results have also unveiled that overhead for CPU-bound workload in virtualised environment is surprisingly high, at 67.2\%. We have found that, for big data applications, the virtualisation overhead is fractional for small jobs but becomes more significant for large jobs, up to 28.6\%.},

  abstract = {Wireless sensor networks are proved to be effective in long-time localized torrential rain monitoring. However, the existing widely used architecture of wireless sensor networks for rain monitoring relies on network transportation and back-end calculation, which causes delay in response to heavy rain in localized areas. Our work improves the architecture by applying logistic regression and support vector machine classification to an intelligent wireless sensor node which is created by Raspberry Pi. The sensor nodes in front-end not only obtain data from sensors, but also can analyze the probabilities of upcoming heavy rain independently and give early warnings to local clients in time. When the sensor nodes send the probability to back-end server, the burdens of network transport are released. We demonstrate by simulation results that our sensor system architecture has potentiality to increase the local response to heavy rain. The monitoring capacity is also raised.},

  abstract = {Noise pollution caused by vehicular traffic is a common problem in urban environments that has been shown to affect people's health and children's cognition. In the last decade, several studies have been conducted to assess this noise, by measuring the equivalent noise pressure level (called L-eq) to acquire an accurate sound map using wireless networks with acoustic sensors. However, even with similar values of L-eq, people can feel the noise differently according to its frequency characteristics. Thus, indexes, which can express people's feelings by subjective measures, are required. In this paper, we analyze the suitability of using the psychoacoustic metrics given by the Zwicker's model, instead of just only considering L-eq. The goal is to evaluate the hardware limitations of a low-cost wireless acoustic sensor network that is used to measure the annoyance, using two types of commercial and off-the-shelf sensor nodes, Tmote-Invent nodes and Raspberry Pi platforms. Moreover, to calculate the parameters using these platforms, different simplifications to the Zwicker's model based on the specific features of road traffic noise are proposed. To validate the different alternatives, the aforementioned nodes are tested in a traffic congested area of Valencia City in a vertical and horizontal network deployment. Based on the results, it is observed that the Raspberry Pi platforms are a feasible low-cost alternative to increase the spatial-temporal resolution, whereas Tmote-Invent nodes do not confirm their suitability due to their limited memory and calibration issues.},

  abstract = {Smart water distribution networks are a good example of a large scale Cyber-Physical System that requires monitoring for precise data analysis and network control. Due to the critical nature of water distribution, an extensive simulation of decision making and control algorithms are required before their deployment. Although some aspects of water network behaviour can be simulated in software such as hydraulic responses in valve changes, software simulators are unable to include dynamic events such as leakages or bursts in physical models. Furthermore, due to safety concerns, contemporary large-scale testbeds are limited to the monitoring processes or control methods with well established safety guarantees. Sophisticated algorithms for dynamic and optimal water network reconfiguration are not yet widespread. This paper presents a small-scale testbed, WaterBox, which allows the simulation of emerging/advanced monitoring and control algorithms in a fail-safe environment. The flexible hydraulic, hardware, and software infrastructure enables a substantial number of experiments. On-going experiments are related to in-node data processing and decision making, energy optimization, event-driven communication, and automatic control.},

It consists of a multi-wavelength light source with two photodiode detectors capable of measuring the transmission and side-scattering of the light in the detector head. This enables the sensor to give qualitative data on the changes in the optical opacity of the water. Laboratory tests to confirm colour and turbidity-related responses are described and the results given. The autonomous sensor underwent field deployments in an estuarine environment, and the results presented here show the sensors capacity to detect changes in opacity and colour relating to potential pollution events. The application of this low-cost optical sensor is in the area of environmental pollution alerts to support a water monitoring programme, where multiple such sensors could be deployed as part of a network.},

  abstract = {The effects of lead contamination on respiratory, acid–base and metabolic status were investigated in the freshwater Australian crayfish, Cherax destructor. Lead has been found to perturb sodium balance in C. destructor and it seemed likely, given the link between ion regulation and gas exchange in aquatic crustaceans, that respiration and acid–base balance would be compromised. Exposure of C. destructor to either 100 or 0.5 mg l−1 Pb in the water caused a reduction in oxygen consumption (ṀO2) of at least 50\% within 24 h, and after 21 days ṀO2 was only 30\% of pre-exposure levels. The reduced ṀO2 was accompanied by a decrease in heart rate from 66±9 to 29±6 beats min−1 in the initial 24 h but ventilation rate remained unchanged (23±5 beats min−1). Concomitantly there was a marked reduction of the oxygen transfer factor (TO2) across the gills from 2.69×10−2 μmol Pa−1, typical of crustaceans, to 1.08×10−2 μmol Pa−1 in impacted crayfish after 21 days exposure. Despite the reduced ṀO2 and TO2, there was almost no change in the acid–base status of Pb impacted crayfish in comparison to controls. While part of the normal response of C. destructor to hypoxia is a hyperventilation leading to lowered ṀO2, the apparent hypoxia caused by Pb impact did not elicit any increase in ventilation and thereby no attempt was made to maintain a ‘normoxic’ ṀO2. Metabolism was not supplemented by anaerobiosis and thus overall energetic demand must have been lowered. This response strongly suggests that Pb promotes a hypometabolic state as well as an elevation of the threshold PO2 at which anaerobiosis would be initiated. Lead contamination would therefore exclude C. destructor from waters prone to hypoxia.},

Similarly, in burrows excavated in field experiments, worm density decreased by 84\%. * Rather than the symbiotic relationship increasing survival when crayfish moved underground, this crayfish species may be faced with a trade-off between the benefits of a mutualism with worms while on the surface and protection from heat stress and desiccation by burrowing when water levels are low.},

Every 5 minutes, the percentage of open mussels and the average number of valve movements per mussel are calculated to describe the activity behaviour of the mussels. Rapid changes in both parameters normally reflect the onset of stress. More than 5½ years of experience in the continuous monitoring of water quality have revealed (1) that the “Dreissena-Monitor” is suited to large rivers like the Rhine as well as small rivers like the Erft or Ruhr, (2) that a lack of technical interruptions guarantees reliable, unattended operation, (3) that normally less than 3 hours of weekly maintenance are required, (4) that the validity check of the primary measurements was capable of identifying dead mussels and poorly aligned measurement components, (5) that the system can operate under unfavourable conditions (e.g. temperatures below 5° C), (6) that mortality rates were low and correlated positively with temperature, and (7) that the alarm thresholds provided a high degree of statistical security.},

Outlet pollutant concentrations were significantly lower than those at the inlet for nearly all monitored constituents. In terms of mass, the system retained most of the incoming pollutants. Besides soluble reactive phosphorus (the mass of which possibly increased), dissolved copper was the least effectively retained; at least 58\% of dissolved copper (and potentially as much as 79\%) was captured by the system. Motor oil was removed most effectively, with 92 to 96\% of the incoming motor oil not leaving the system.

  abstract = {The rate of oxygen consumption (OC) of 9 species of freshwater mussels was measured under declining dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations. The effects of temperature for some species also was investigated. The pattern of the OC vs. DO curve for each species was used in a hyperbolic model to compare abilities to regulate OC under low oxygen conditions. At 24.5 °C, Pyganodon grandis (from lakes), Amblema plicata and Quadrula pustulosa (from mud or sand in large rivers), Elliptio complanata (from pool areas in rivers), and Elliptio fisheriana and Elliptio lanceolata (from bank margins of rivers) were better able to maintain OC under low DO than were Villosa iris and Villosa constricta (which inhabit riffles) and Pleurobema cordatum (found in rivers with moderate flow). Villosa iris was especially sensitive to low oxygen conditions. The ability to maintain normal OC at low DO was improved considerably at 16.5 °C for V. iris, P. grandis and E. complanata. It is concluded that oxygen regulation ability appears to be related to the degree of hypoxia a species normally experiences in its habitat type, and it is enhanced at low temperature. The measurement of OC vs. DO may be a useful technique for estimating DO water quality criteria for endangered species because it is noninvasive.},

Plants of Muhlenbergia capillaris (Lam.) Trin.

Between flooding events, plants were drained for 6 d with no additional irrigation. The flood-drain process was repeated five times. Non-flooded plants were hand watered as needed. Plants were irrigated (non-flooded) or flooded with one of several tap water solutions, each with a different P concentration ranging from 0 to 0.8 mg·liter−1 (ppm) P (hereafter referred to as P irrigation rate). The experiment was repeated once (total two runs). Shoot dry weight (SDW) root dry weight (RDW) were higher in non-flooded plants than in flooded plants in both runs. Shoot dry weight increased linearly with an increasing P irrigation rate, while RDW changed cubically with increasing P irrigation rates in run 1 (no effect on either in run 2). Phosphorus concentration in leachate increased with increasing P irrigation rate in run 1 but not in run 2. Phosphorus concentration in leachate was usually higher in flooded plants than in non-flooded plants in both runs. All plants maintained root and shoot growth when flooded suggesting M. capillaris would be appropriate native species for rain gardens or bioretention areas. Phosphorus concentrations in leachate were lower than what was applied indicating P was removed via plant uptake or substrate adsorption or both.},

  abstract = {Although nitrogen (N) is prevalent in urban stormwater, regulation of this pollutant has occurred only more recently. This paper reviews the concerns over N in urban stormwater, mechanisms and design enhancements for N uptake and denitrification through various stormwater control measures (SCMs), and presents opportunities to integrate this current knowledge into the regulatory framework. A survey of personnel directly involved in various aspects of US state and territory NPDES programs revealed that the top three pollutants of concern were total suspended solids (TSS), pathogens and bacteria, and total phosphorus (TP). Surprisingly, nitrate (NO3−) was of little concern among the survey respondents, with 3.9\% giving it the highest level of concern, 2.0\% ranking it second, and 6.0\% ranking it third. When asked which strategies were currently used in their geographic area for stormwater management, the most common results were wet ponds and dry ponds. At the same time, wet ponds and dry ponds were recognized as less effective practices to manage stormwater. A review of current literature reveals that several alternative SCMs, such as bioretention, filters, and wetlands, show greater promise in their ability to remove N from stormwater than more conventional practices such as dry ponds and wet ponds. Enhanced N removal via denitrification and plant uptake is often observed under the combination of aerobic followed by sustained anoxic conditions, the presence of a carbon source (organic material), and the presence of mature, dense vegetation. Given the lack of concern or awareness of local officials related to N loading from urban stormwater, and variation in the efficacy of various SCMs, it is not surprising that regulators remain focused on conventional dry pond and wet pond control measures. More needs to be done to quantify the impact of urban sources of N on water quality and aquatic ecosystems. In addition, greater focus needs to be placed on the development of design criteria for SCMs, such as bioretention, filters, and constructed wetlands, which show more promise for N removal.},

Dramatic impacts were observed on local, regional, and national scales. Locally, samples from 7 of 13 Milwaukee, Wisconsin area streams exhibited toxicity in Ceriodaphnia dubia and Pimephales promelas bioassays during road-salt runoff. Another Milwaukee stream was sampled from 1996 to 2008 with 72\% of 37 samples exhibiting toxicity in chronic bioassays and 43\% in acute bioassays. The maximum chloride concentration was 7730 mg/L. Regionally, in southeast Wisconsin, continuous specific conductance was monitored as a chloride surrogate in 11 watersheds with urban land use from 6.0 to 100\%. Elevated specific conductance was observed between November and April at all sites, with continuing effects between May and October at sites with the highest specific conductance. Specific conductance was measured as high as 30 800 μS/cm (Cl = 11 200 mg/L). Chloride concentrations exceeded U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) acute (860 mg/L) and chronic (230 mg/L) water-quality criteria at 55 and 100\% of monitored sites, respectively. Nationally, U.S. Geological Survey historical data were examined for 13 northern and 4 southern metropolitan areas. Chloride concentrations exceeded USEPA water-quality criteria at 55\% (chronic) and 25\% (acute) of the 168 monitoring locations in northern metropolitan areas from November to April. Only 16\% (chronic) and 1\% (acute) of sites exceeded criteria from May to October. At southern sites, very few samples exceeded chronic water-quality criteria, and no samples exceeded acute criteria.},

Bioretention is a low-impact development technology that has been advocated for use in urban and other developed areas. This work provides an in-depth analysis on removal of nutrients from a synthetic stormwater runoff by bioretention. Results have indicated good removal of phosphorus (70 to 85\%) and total Kjeldahl nitrogen (55 to 65\%). Nitrate reduction was poor ({\textless}20\%) and, in several cases, nitrate production was noted. Variations in flowrate (intensity) and duration had a moderate affect on nutrient removal. Mass balances demonstrate the importance of water attenuation in the facility in reducing mass nutrient loads. Captured nitrogen can be converted to nitrate between storm events and subsequently washed from the system. Analysis on the fate of nutrients in bioretention suggests that accumulation of phosphorus and nitrogen may be controlled by carefully managing growing and harvesting of vegetation.},

Bioretention is a low-impact-development best management practice that has the potential to improve stormwater quality from developed areas. The practice represents a soil, sand, organic matter, and vegetation-based storage and infiltration facility used in parking lots and on individual lots to treat runoff. Investigations using pilot-plant laboratory bioretention systems and two existing bioretention facilities documented their effectiveness at removing low levels of lead, copper, and zinc from synthetic stormwater runoff. Removal rates of these metals (based on concentration and total mass) were excellent, reaching close to 100\% for all metals under most conditions, with effluent copper and lead levels mostly less than 5 μg/L and zinc less than 25 μg/L. Somewhat less removal was noted for shallow bioretention depths. Runoff pH, duration, intensity, and pollutant concentrations were varied, and all had minimal effect on removal. The two field investigations generally supported the laboratory studies. Overall, excellent removal of dissolved heavy metals can be expected through bioretention infiltration. Although the accumulation of metals is a concern, buildup problems are not anticipated for more than 15 years because of the low metal concentrations expected in runoff.},

Bioretention facilities consist of porous soil a topping layer of hardwood mulch, and a variety of different plant species.A detailed study of the characteristics and performance of bioretention systems for the removal of several heavy metals (copper, lead, and zinc) and nutrients (phosphorus, total Kjeldahl nitrogen [TKN], ammonium and nitrate) from a synthetic urban stormwater runoff was completed using batch and column adsorption studies along with pilot-scale laboratory systems. The roles of the soil, mulch, and plants in the removal of heavy metals and nutrients were evaluated to estimate the treatment capacity of laboratory bioretention systems. Reductions in concentrations of all metals were excellent ({\textgreater}90\%) with specific metal removals of 15 to 145 mg/m2 per event. Moderate reductions of TKN, ammonium, and phosphorus levels were found (60 to 80\%). Little nitrate was removed, and nitrate production was noted in several cases. The importance of the mulch layer in metal removal was identified. Overall results support the use of bioretention as a stormwater best management practice and indicate the need for further research and development.},

Bioretention is an infiltration/filtration practice containing a mixed layer of about 90 cm of soil, sand, and organic matter, planted with appropriate vegetation. Field water quality monitoring and bioretention media core analyses were performed. The results indicate that bioretention is a promising management practice to control runoff PAH pollutants. The PAH event mean concentration (EMC) reduction ranged from 31 to 99\%, with a mean discharge EMC of 0.22 μg/L. The mass load decreased from a mean value of 0.0180 kg/ha yr to 0.0025 kg/ha yr, suggesting an average PAH mass load reduction of 87\% to the discharging watershed. The most dominant PAH species monitored were fluoranthene and pyrene. Influent PAHs indicated strong affiliation with runoff total suspended solids (TSS). As such, PAH removal positively correlated with TSS removal. Low rainfall depth was associated with high influent PAH concentration and resulted in favorable PAH removal. Source investigation suggested that the PAHs measured in the monitored cell were from pyrogenic sources, likely resulting from vehicle combustion processes. Sealers used in parking lots and driveway coatings were also a possible source of PAHs. Media core analyses indicated that the intercepted PAH compounds transported only a few centimeters vertically in the soil media near the runoff entrance location, suggesting that a shallow cell design may be adequate for systems focusing on PAH removal.},

Replicated rain gardens were constructed in Haddam, CT, to capture shingled-roof runoff. The gardens were sized to store the first 2.54 cm (1 inch) of runoff. Influent, overflow and percolate flow were measured using tipping buckets and sampled passively. Precipitation was also measured and sampled for quality. All weekly composite water samples were analyzed for total phosphorus (TP), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), ammonia-nitrogen (NH3-N), and nitrite+nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N). Monthly composite samples were analyzed for copper (Cu), lead (Pb) and zinc (Zn). Redox potential was measured using platinum electrodes. Poor treatment of NO3-N, TKN, organic-N, and TP in roof runoff was observed. Many Cu, Pb and Zn samples were below detection limit, so statistical analysis was not performed on these pollutants. The only pollutants significantly lower in the effluent than in the influent were NH3-N in both gardens and total-N in one garden. The design used for these rain gardens worked well for overall flow retention, but had little impact pollutant concentrations in percolate. These results suggest that if an underdrain is not connected to the stormwater system, high flow and pollutant retention could be achieved with the 2.54 cm design method.},

  abstract = {1. Droughts have become prevalent in the south-eastern U.S.A. and are predicted to become more common in the future. Drought conditions have particularly strong negative effects on sessile aquatic organisms with limited dispersal ability. This study explored the linkages between physiological tolerance, behavioural response and survival of three species of freshwater mussels subjected to drought. 2. To assess physiological tolerance, we measured survival under desiccation at 25, 35 and 45 °C in the laboratory. To assess behavioural responses, we tracked horizontal and vertical movement of mussels in a drying stream reach. 3. Uniomerus tetralasmus showed the greatest desiccation tolerance, Lampsilis straminea was intermediate, and Pyganodon grandis had the lowest tolerance at all temperatures. 4. In the drying stream reach, U. tetralasmus showed little horizontal movement and quickly became stranded. The other two species tracked the receding water. It was not until the pool had been reduced to c. 10\% of its original size that ≥50\% of P. grandis and L. straminea became stranded. 5. Uniomerus tetralasmus and L. straminea burrowed in response to becoming stranded; however, both species burrowed only shallowly (3–4 cm), presumably because burrowing to greater depths did not convey increasing thermal refuge. Pyganodon grandis rarely burrowed. No P. grandis survived the 15-week drought, while 45\% of L. straminea and 77\% of U. tetralasmus survived. 6. Three strategies emerged for freshwater mussels to cope with drought conditions: tracking (intolerant), track then burrow (semi-tolerant) and burrowing (tolerant). Results suggest that drought poses the greatest threat to intolerant trackers, while tolerant burrowers are the most resistant to drought conditions.},

  abstract = {An early warning system for biological monitoring of aquatic environment is proposed, which is based on an analysis of mussel valve movements. It consists of an analog monitor of an original design (analog recorder and analyzer of opening/closing of valves in a group of mussels) and outside devices (multimeters, computers, and mobile phones). In the monitor, an analysis of the state of valve position sensors, summing/averaging of voltage values, and generation of a warning signal are performed in the analog mode. The proposed system (a) diagnoses the state of valve position sensors, (b) determines the voltage representing the average valve opening in a group of mussels (6–12 individuals), (c) generates a warning signal; and, by means of peripheral devices, (d) registers the average voltage of sensors and (e) transmits a warning signal via a mobile communication net. The system can provide an addition (and, sometimes, an alternative) to complicated digital systems analogous to MosselMonitor®.},

  abstract = {Biofiltration systems are a recommended and increasingly popular technology for stormwater management; however there is a general lack of performance data for these systems, particularly at the field scale. The objective of this study was to investigate the hydrologic and pollutant removal performance of three field-scale biofiltration systems in two different climates. Biofilters were shown to effectively attenuate peak runoff flow rates by at least 80\%. Performance assessment of a lined biofilter demonstrated that retention of inflow volumes by the filter media, for subsequent loss via evapotranspiration, reduced runoff volumes by 33\% on average. Retention of water was found to be most influenced by inflow volumes, although only small to medium storms could be assessed. Vegetation was shown to be important for maintaining hydraulic capacity, because root growth and senescence countered compaction and clogging. Suspended solids and heavy metals were effectively removed, irrespective of the design configuration, with load reductions generally in excess of 90\%. In contrast, nutrient retention was variable, and ranged from consistent leaching to effective and reliable removal, depending on the design. To ensure effective removal of phosphorus, a filter medium with a low phosphorus content should be selected. Nitrogen is more difficult to remove because it is highly soluble and strongly influenced by the variable wetting and drying regime that is inherent in biofilter operation. The results of this research suggest that reconfiguration of biofilter design to manage the deleterious effects of drying on biological activity is necessary to ensure long term nitrogen removal.},

At one of the sites, rain events were simulated, while actual runoff events were monitored at the other two sites. In all cases, concentrations of total suspended solids (TSS), copper, lead and zinc were effectively and reliably reduced, despite variations in inflow concentrations. Two biofiltration systems also effectively reduced phosphorus concentrations, however the third system discharged elevated phosphorus concentrations relative to inflow; this is attributed to poor specification of filter media properties. Effluent nitrogen concentrations were more variable at all sites and ranged from being substantially lower to considerably higher than inflow concentrations. Flow was also measured at two sites, where it was determined that volumetric reductions in runoff further improved pollutant removal. TSS and heavy metals will be reliably removed by a wide range of soil-based filter media, as will phopshorus, as long as the phosphorus content of the filter media is low. However, nitrogen removal remains a challenge because it is easily transformed to soluble forms and is influenced by wetting and drying. These results are essentially consistent with related laboratory studies.},

  abstract = {.  Burrowing crayfish are potentially important ecological links between terrestrial and aquatic systems, but little is known about what drives their local distribution patterns. We investigated potential mechanisms underlying the patchy local distribution of the devil crayfish (Cambarus diogenes Girard) in a stream floodplain ecosystem of the coastal plain of Alabama. We used a series of field surveys and laboratory trials to: 1) quantify local distributions and soil-type associations, 2) identify soil preferences of juveniles and adults, 3) examine the effects of biotic (adult occupancy) and abiotic (soil compaction) factors on juvenile burrowing preferences, and 4) investigate the role of floodplain connectivity on burrow density. Juvenile crayfish were more abundant in sandy streamside soils, whereas adults were more abundant in clay-based floodplain soils. In laboratory preference trials in artificial burrowing chambers, adults and juveniles showed affinity for floodplain over streamside soils, a result suggesting that factors other than soil preference influence field patterns. When juveniles were presented with situations where adults were established, they initiated burrows in association with the adult burrows regardless of soil type. Soil compaction did not influence juvenile burrowing preference, but did result in smaller burrows in laboratory trials. Adult burrow density in the floodplain was negatively related to stream bank angle and top-of-bank height. Juvenile C. diogenes took longer to climb banks with high bank angles than those with low bank angles, a result suggesting increased risk of predation and desiccation associated with disconnected floodplain conditions. Local distribution of C. diogenes burrows in stream/floodplain systems appears to be a product of interacting physical and biological factors rather than of soil-type preferences. Stream–floodplain connectivity may affect recruitment and population viability of burrowing crayfish.},

As is the case with many native burrowing crayfishes, virtually nothing is known about the biology and ecology of this species. To help fill this gap, the current study provides information on population demographics, environmental correlates of activity, burrowing behavior, and habitat fidelity of C. harti. Field surveys from the type locality revealed that crayfish could be found throughout the year, with a near 3:1 ratio of female to male adults captured, an ovigerous female found in June, and the highest number of small juveniles found in August. Adults were not found together in burrows; however, juveniles were often found sharing the burrows of females. Burrowing activity was generally higher in the summer than winter, and also increased with receding groundwater levels. Based on observations and experiments with artificial burrowing chambers (ABCs), the burrows of C. harti followed a predictable form and were often capped with at least one chimney of seemingly deliberate construction. Total burrow area and mean chimney pellet diameter increased with crayfish size. It appeared that C. harti will burrow in other soils, but displays a strong affinity to its type-locality soils, particularly below groundwater level. Observations from a communal ABC revealed that adults use burrows to brood young and will share burrows with other adults for a period of time, possibly during burrow construction and/or times of disturbance, but eventually tend to segregate to solitary occupancy. Taken together, these data offer insight into the biology and ecology of this highly endemic and elusive animal that will be useful for management and conservation efforts and provide much-needed scientific information about burrowing crayfishes in general.},

Twenty-one reference stream reaches were identified in the Tallapoosa drainage of Alabama, ranging from 0.2 to 242 km2 drainage area. Geomorphic surveys were conducted in each stream to measure riffle cross-sections and longitudinal profiles and related to drainage area to develop regional curves. Fish, crayfish, and benthic macroinvertebrates were collected from each surveyed reach and related to drainage area and geomorphic data to provide associated biological community endpoints. Bankfull channel cross-section area, width, mean depth, and estimated discharge were strongly correlated to watershed drainage area, similar to efforts in other areas of the Piedmont ecoregion. Multiple measures of fish assemblages and crayfish size were strongly predicted by drainage area and geomorphic dimensions. Macroinvertebrates showed no taxonomic and limited functional relationships with drainage area and geomorphic dimension. These tools, which integrate geomorphological and ecological conditions, can result in improved stream evaluations and designs increasing the effectiveness of stream restoration projects.},

We constructed biofiltration mesocosms to assess nutrient removal (nitrogen, phosphorus and carbon) under experimental conditions. Different types of media were compared (gravel, sand, and sandy-loam) in vegetated and non-vegetated mesocosms (six treatments in total). Five plant species were used. Vegetated sand and vegetated sandy-loam provided the best overall treatment. Vegetated mesocosms were very effective in removing nitrogen (63–77\% removal) and phosphorus (85–94\% removal) from synthetic stormwater, and removed substantially more nutrients than the non-vegetated treatments. All treatments removed a substantial portion of the carbon from the stormwater (28–66\%). When flushed with tap water, nitrogen and phosphorus were retained by the vegetated mesocosms, but leached from the non-vegetated mesocosms. Plant growth was most vigorous in the sandy-loam media, indicating that this is a good growth media, even without the addition of organic matter.},

The toxicity of these metals to crayfish acclimated at 17, 20, 23/24, and 27°C increased with temperature (by 7–20\% between 20 and 24°C and 14–26\% between 20 and 27°C) as judged by the lowering of LT50 (time to kill 50\% of test animals at a fixed concentration) values. A 4°C rise in temperature (from 20 to 24°C), which increased the toxicity of copper by about 7\%, increased the rate of oxygen consumption by about 34\%. Heavy metals inhibited the rate of oxygen consumption at all temperatures. In 20°C-acclimated crayfish, copper caused about 17\% inhibition of oxygen consumption compared to about 7–12\% by other metals including the most toxic cadmium. A 3–4°C rise in temperature tripled the inhibitory effect of copper (20\%), cadmium and zinc (26 and 18\%, respectively), but not of lead, on oxygen consumption. A 7°C-rise in temperature (from 20 to 27°C) increased the inhibitory effect of heavy metals, including lead, on oxygen consumption by up to 54\% in the case of copper. The data indicate that rising global temperatures (currently 0.60°C) associated with climate change can have the potential to increase the sensitivity of aquatic animals to heavy metals in their environment. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Here, we discuss telemetry, acoustic monitoring, vision-based monitoring, measures of ventilatory activity, electrocardiography, and fiber-optic plethysmography. Assessment of water quality must be based, not only on physicochemical characteristics of the current environment as determined by chemical analyses, but also on observations of the physiology and behavior of its inhabitants. Real-time biomonitoring is suggested as the most reliable method, since it incorporates living organisms into the system to serve as biosensors. The potential application of the methods discussed includes use at water treatment plants and water supply stations for prevention of hazardous toxicological events, and, for aquaculture, in ponds, lakes, and aquariums for monitoring growth, population size, and behavior traits.},

We examined the effects of temperature, photoperiod, and female gravidity on mantle lure display and conglutinate release by Ligumia subrostrata (Say, 1831) in 2 laboratory experiments. In the 1st experiment, we examined the use of these strategies in 4 temperature treatments (5, 15, 25, 35°C) and 3 photoperiods (10∶14, 12∶12, and 14∶10 h light∶ dark). In the 2nd experiment, we observed infection strategies under ambient conditions with flow-through pond water. Water temperature appeared to be the primary cue governing use of these strategies. Lure display occurred over a protracted period, but the highest display frequency occurred between ∼11 and 20°C. Lure display declined rapidly above this range and ceased altogether {\textgreater}28°C. Release of conglutinates increased coincident with the decrease in lure display but, at ambient temperatures, occurred over a protracted period similar in duration to lure display. Females that were not gravid at the beginning of the experiment did not display lures, and gravid females whose gills were flushed of glochidia displayed for only a short period during which frequency of display was much lower than gravid individuals. Ligumia subrostrata exhibits a temperature-mediated switch between alternate host strategies. We present evidence that lure display is a primary strategy for host infection and conglutinate release is a secondary, bet-hedging strategy to reduce wastage of glochidia that ultimately must be cleared from the gills at the end of the reproductive season.},

  abstract = {Elevated suspended solids are a widespread stressor of aquatic ecosystems, but their effects on growth and reproduction in freshwater mussels are largely unknown. We fertilized experimental ponds to create a gradient in total suspended solids (TSS) and examined the effects of TSS on growth, nutritional status, reproduction, and clearance rate in Ligumia subrostrata. The number of females that became gravid declined sharply with increasing TSS, and no gravid females were found in the highest TSS treatments. The proportion of gravid females was not related to the TSS organic∶inorganic ratio. Fertilization was an all-or-nothing phenomenon. In all females that did become gravid, 98 to 99\% of eggs were fertilized regardless of TSS, and total fecundity was unrelated to TSS. Clearance rates declined sharply as TSS increased but showed a threshold relationship in which clearance was uniformly low at TSS {\textgreater} ∼8 mg/L. Reproductive failure probably was not caused by poor body condition or nutritional status because growth (length and mass) and energetic status (measured as caloric density) were not related to TSS. We propose 2 mechanisms that implicate interference of TSS with fertilization as the cause of reproductive failure. Reduced clearance rate could decrease the chance of females encountering suspended sperm during filter feeding, or an increase in pseudofeces production could bind sperm in mucus and lead to its egestion before fertilization. Interruption of fertilization coincident with high TSS is a potential mechanism to explain the lack of mussel recruitment in many locations. Monitoring and reduction of TSS, especially during the spawning season, may help create conditions necessary for maintenance and recovery of mussel populations. More research is needed to explore the generality of this pattern across a broad range of mussel species including those adapted to lotic environments or that use different brooding strategies.},

Predicted spatial profiles and partitioning patterns of captured metals were compared to data derived from a bioretention cell in the District of Columbia. Zinc, lead, and copper profiles showed a high surface accumulation, significantly decreasing with the media depth. Surface street particle-enriched areas had the highest heavy metal levels, demonstrating a close relationship between capture of metals and runoff particles. Sequential extractions suggested that most captured metals were of anthropogenic origin. Soluble-exchangeable bound metals from the sequential extraction correlated well with predicted aqueous dissolved metals; the more strongly associated metal fractions correlated with modeled runoff and media particulate metals. A simple risk evaluation indicated that lead is the limiting metal in bioretention accumulation. On the basis of information collected in this study, a shallow bioretention cell design is suggested for systems with a focus on metal capture.},

The whole data set composed almost 70 samples and 350 test results, which were reduced to toxicity point values using a toxicity scale. About two fifths of all data did not show any toxic responses, one fifth indicated severe toxicity, one fifth confirmed toxicity, and one fifth potential toxicity. When comparing urban stormwater toxicity to that of multi-lane divided highway (MLDH) runoff, the main difference was noted for the severe toxicity level; almost 20\% of MLDH samples were severely toxic compared to 1\% of urban stormwater samples. The MLDH data were obtained at the edge of the pavement, and although attenuation of runoff toxicity during transport can be expected, particularly m grassed swales, additional research is required.},

  abstract = {Urban stormwater contains a complex mixture of contaminants that can be acutely toxic to aquatic biota. Green stormwater infrastructure (GSI) is a set of evolving technologies intended to reduce impacts on natural systems by slowing and filtering runoff. The extent to which GSI methods work as intended is usually assessed in terms of water quantity (hydrology) and quality (chemistry). Biological indicators of GSI effectiveness have received less attention, despite an overarching goal of protecting the health of aquatic species. Here we use the zebrafish (Danio rerio) experimental model to evaluate bioinfiltration as a relatively inexpensive technology for treating runoff from an urban highway with dense motor vehicle traffic. Zebrafish embryos exposed to untreated runoff (48–96h; six storm events) displayed an array of developmental abnormalities, including delayed hatching, reduced growth, pericardial edema, microphthalmia (small eyes), and reduced swim bladder inflation. Three of the six storms were acutely lethal, and sublethal toxicity was evident across all storms, even when stormwater was diluted by as much as 95\% in clean water. As anticipated from exposure to cardiotoxic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), untreated runoff also caused heart failure, as indicated by circulatory stasis, pericardial edema, and looping defects. Bioretention treatment dramatically improved stormwater quality and reversed nearly all forms of developmental toxicity. The zebrafish model therefore provides a versatile experimental platform for rapidly assessing GSI effectiveness.},

Benchmarks for GSI success are usually framed in terms of hydrology and water chemistry, with reduced flow and loadings of toxic chemical contaminants as primary metrics. Despite the central goal of protecting aquatic species abundance and diversity, the effectiveness of GSI treatments in maintaining diverse assemblages of sensitive aquatic taxa has not been widely evaluated. In the present study we characterized the baseline toxicity of untreated urban runoff from a highway in Seattle, WA, across six storm events. For all storms, first flush runoff was toxic to the daphniid Ceriodaphnia dubia, causing up to 100\% mortality or impairing reproduction among survivors. We then evaluated whether soil media used in bioretention, a conventional GSI method, could reduce or eliminate toxicity to juvenile coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) as well as their macroinvertebrate prey, including cultured C. dubia and wild-collected mayfly nymphs (Baetis spp.). Untreated highway runoff was generally lethal to salmon and invertebrates, and this acute mortality was eliminated when the runoff was filtered through soil media in bioretention columns. Soil treatment also protected against sublethal reproductive toxicity in C. dubia. Thus, a relatively inexpensive GSI technology can be highly effective at reversing the acutely lethal and sublethal effects of urban runoff on multiple aquatic species.},

Green stormwater infrastructure methods such as bioretention are increasingly used to improve water quality by filtering chemical contaminants that may be harmful to fish and other species. Ubiquitous examples of toxics in runoff from highways and other impervious surfaces include polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Certain PAHs are known to cause functional and structural defects in developing fish hearts. Therefore, abnormal heart development in fish can be a sensitive measure of clean water technology effectiveness. Here we use the zebrafish experimental model to assess the effects of untreated runoff on the expression of genes that are classically responsive to contaminant exposures, as well as heart-related genes that may underpin the familiar cardiotoxicity phenotype. Further, we assess the effectiveness of soil bioretention for treating runoff, as measured by prevention of both visible cardiac toxicity and corresponding gene regulation. We find that contaminants in the dissolved phase of runoff (e.g., PAHs) are cardiotoxic and that soil bioretention protects against these harmful effects. Molecular markers were more sensitive than visible toxicity indicators, and several cardiac-related genes show promise as novel tools for evaluating the effectiveness of evolving stormwater mitigation strategies.},

PC defines the partial pressure of oxygen (Po2) at which an oxygen regulator switches to a conformer. However, not all animals show such clear patterns in oxygen consumption rate (), and there are many methods for determining PC. This study assesses two methods that determine regulatory ability and four that calculate PC. A new method, the regulation index (RI), assigns to an animal a relative measure of regulatory ability by calculating the area under the  versus Po2 curve that is greater than a linear trend. The six methods are applied to developmental  data of two amphibians, Pseudophryne bibronii and Crinia georgiana. The four methods used to determine PC produced similar results but failed to identify the increase in regulation on hatching in C. georgiana or the greater regulation in larval C. georgiana compared with P. bibronii. Of the two methods that evaluated regulation, only the RI satisfactorily represented the entire range of Po2. The RI is advantageous because it has clearly defined limits and does not constrain data to fit any single pattern.

  abstract = {Eleven storm water treatment strategies were evaluated for water quality performance and storm volume reduction during rainfall-runoff events between September 2004 and August 2005. Evaluated treatment strategies included structural best management practices (BMPs) (swales, retention ponds), low-impact development (LID) designs (treatment wetland, filtration and infiltration designs), and manufactured BMPs (filtration, infiltration, and hydrodynamic separators). Contaminant event mean concentration, performance efficiency, and mass-based first flush were evaluated for storms with varying rainfall-runoff characteristics. Previous research demonstrated that treatment performance of storm water control measures varies widely in response to site-specific contaminant loading functions. For that reason, the devices were tested in parallel, with a single influent source providing uniform loading to all devices. Treatment strategies were uniformly sized to target a rainfall-runoff depth equivalent to 90\% of the annual volume of rainfall. Under the parallel and uniformly sized configuration, a normalized performance evaluation is possible because treatment strategies of the same scale receive runoff from events of the same duration, intensity, peak flow, volume, antecedent dry period, and watershed loading. Runoff constituent analyses included total suspended solids (TSS), total petroleum hydrocarbons-diesel, dissolved inorganic nitrogen, and total zinc. Several water quality parameters (temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, conductivity) were monitored as real-time data. Performance evaluations indicate that several LID designs have removal efficiencies of 80\% to 100\%. In contrast, conventional structural BMPs perform poorly for most measures except for the pond with TSS. The manufactured systems tended to vary widely and were dependent on the design and contaminant of interest.},

In this study, we examined whether another invertebrate, a crayfish (Procambarus acutus), also experienced elevated SMR in response to the same contaminants. We compared SMR of individuals inhabiting the contaminated site with SMR of individuals from uncontaminated reference sites. We also examined SMR of individuals collected from the reference areas and exposed in the laboratory for 50 days to sediment and food derived from the contaminated site. Individuals collected from the contaminated site had elevated SMR compared to individuals collected from the unpolluted areas (25.1 vs. 19.2 J g−1 day−1). Individuals exposed to contaminated sediment and food in the laboratory experienced elevations in SMR compared to controls after 27 days of exposure (35.2 vs. 29.4 J g−1 day−1), but after 50 days of exposure, metabolic rate no longer differed between treatments. Growth of contaminant-exposed individuals was lower than growth of reference animals throughout the laboratory study. Elevated SMR associated with contaminant exposure may reflect energy-demanding mechanisms required to combat deleterious effects of contaminants. Our results support the prediction that increases in energy expenditure in the contaminated habitat would negatively influence production processes, such as growth. Results from this study in conjunction with observations from other species suggest that increased SMR is a common response among several taxa to the mixture of contaminants in the study site.},

The importance of treating stormwater as part of an integrated phosphorus pollution management plan is now recognized. Bioretention systems are urban stormwater best management practices (BMPs) that rely on terrestrial ecosystem functions to retain storm flows and reduce pollutant loads. Bioretention has shown great potential for stormwater quantity and quality control. However, phosphorus removal has been inconsistent in bioretention systems, with phosphorus leaching observed in some systems. Numerical models can be used to predict the performance of bioretention systems under various conditions and loadings. The aim of this paper is to identify and characterize bioretention phosphorus cycling processes, with a particular focus on process modelling.

Les systèmes de biorétention sont des pratiques de gestion exemplaires (PGE) pour les eaux pluviales urbaines qui dépendent des fonctions d’un écosystème terrestre pour retenir les eaux pluviales et réduire leur charge polluante. La biorétention présente un fort potentiel pour le contrôle de la quantité et qualité des eaux pluviales. Cependant, le traitement du phosphore a été variable à l’intérieur des systèmes de biorétention et un lessivage de phosphore a été observé dans certains systèmes.

  abstract = {. Stormwater runoff in a coastal urban area (San Diego County, CA) produced significant toxicity to early life stages of medaka (Oryzias latipes) and Menidia (M. beryllina). Exposure of embryos to lower concentrations (5 to 25\%) increased the incidence of abnormal swim bladder inflation and other teratogenic responses, whereas higher concentrations resulted in mortality or failure to hatch. Comparisons of EC50s for mortality and failure to hatch with concentrations of individual chemical pollutants (including Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, Ni, and Zn) revealed low correlations; however, the correlation with total metals was high (−0.84) and corresponded with sample exceedences of Water Quality Criteria (WQC) for Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn. This strong association between developmental toxicity and toxic metal content of storm water compared favorably with developmental anomalies reported in other studies. Analytical chemistry data for pesticides that may have been in these samples were limited to selected pesticides found usually below detection limits. Greater toxicity of the watershed effluents sampled was generally associated with more developed land surface and less open space. Both medaka and Menidia were found to be useful for studying effects of stormwater on embryonic and early larval development.},

  abstract = {* Adult coho salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch return each autumn to freshwater spawning habitats throughout western North America. The migration coincides with increasing seasonal rainfall, which in turn increases storm water run-off, particularly in urban watersheds with extensive impervious land cover. Previous field assessments in urban stream networks have shown that adult coho are dying prematurely at high rates ({\textgreater}50\%). Despite significant management concerns for the long-term conservation of threatened wild coho populations, a causal role for toxic run-off in the mortality syndrome has not been demonstrated. * We exposed otherwise healthy coho spawners to: (i) artificial storm water containing mixtures of metals and petroleum hydrocarbons, at or above concentrations previously measured in urban run-off; (ii) undiluted storm water collected from a high traffic volume urban arterial road (i.e. highway run-off); and (iii) highway run-off that was first pre-treated via bioinfiltration through experimental soil columns to remove pollutants. * We find that mixtures of metals and petroleum hydrocarbons – conventional toxic constituents in urban storm water – are not sufficient to cause the spawner mortality syndrome. By contrast, untreated highway run-off collected during nine distinct storm events was universally lethal to adult coho relative to unexposed controls. Lastly, the mortality syndrome was prevented when highway run-off was pretreated by soil infiltration, a conventional green storm water infrastructure technology. * Our results are the first direct evidence that: (i) toxic run-off is killing adult coho in urban watersheds, and (ii) inexpensive mitigation measures can improve water quality and promote salmon survival. * Synthesis and applications. Coho salmon, an iconic species with exceptional economic and cultural significance, are an ecological sentinel for the harmful effects of untreated urban run-off. Wild coho populations cannot withstand the high rates of mortality that are now regularly occurring in urban spawning habitats. Green storm water infrastructure or similar pollution prevention methods should be incorporated to the maximal extent practicable, at the watershed scale, for all future development and redevelopment projects, particularly those involving transportation infrastructure.},

DOI: 10.1111/j.1752-1688.2011.00633.x Abstract:  We used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to examine reservoir-mediated shifts in spring to fall exposure of aquatic organisms to the spring atrazine pulse over four years in a Midwestern stream-reservoir system. Peak atrazine concentrations in the major inflowing stream exceeded 10 μg/l in all four years. The reservoir had a beneficial effect in two of four years by diluting atrazine below the 10 μg/l threshold. However, during the other two years, exposure times above 10 μg/l were approximately doubled in the reservoir compared to the major inflowing stream. Thresholds of 3 and 5 μg/l were exceeded during all four years in the reservoir. The uplake and downlake reservoir sites were four to five times more likely to exceed these thresholds and aquatic organisms were subjected to longer exposure times above these thresholds compared to the inflowing stream. Release of elevated atrazine concentrations from the reservoir extended exposure times in the outflowing stream. This effect was most pronounced just below the dam. Aquatic organisms upstream of the reservoir were most likely to experience acute exposures whereas organisms within and immediately downstream of the reservoir were more likely to experience chronic exposures. The ubiquity of reservoirs and the annual spring herbicide flush highlight the importance of considering the presence and relative location of reservoirs when assessing risk to aquatic communities as well as locations of drinking water intakes.},

A bioretention system receiving water from a light industrial catchment and a busy road was designed, built and monitored for changes in soil physics as well as hydrological and hydrochemical efficiency. The soils in the bioretention system were designed to have high metal removal potential and high permeability to compensate for undersized bioretention volume. The inflow hydrograph was a series of sharp peaks with little baseflow, typical of runoff from impervious surfaces. The bioretention system smoothed the hydrograph by reducing peak flow and volume for all 12 events monitored in detail. Overflow occurred in 10 events indicating the increased permeability did not fully compensate for the undersized volume. Runoff was heavily polluted with sediment and heavy metals, in particular zinc. The majority of the zinc, lead and Total Suspended Sediments were removed from the stormwater that flowed through the bioretention system, with TSS and total zinc concentrations reducing by orders of magnitude. Despite high removal efficiency, median concentrations of zinc exiting the bioretention system still exceeded ecosystem health guidelines and the bioretention system was both a source and sink of copper.},

Reduced flood frequency and lowered water tables typify incised low-order streams of the region. The objective of this study was to determine if a quantifiable shift in riparian vegetation community structure exists along a gradient of channel incision. Stream channel incision was described using bank height ratio (BHR), defined as the ratio of streambank height to bankfull depth. Ten low-order streams in the Alabama Piedmont were selected across a gradient of BHR values (1.0–5.2). Stream incision is strongly correlated with a shift of community type in the ground flora stratum, from wetland-adapted species at low degrees of incision to plants typical of upland settings at incised sites. Based on Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) ordinations, functional composition of the ground flora layer was significantly related to median groundwater depth and BHR. These results suggest strong linkages between channel incision, subsequent lowered water table levels and decreased soil moisture, and herbaceous/ground flora composition in floodplains of the Alabama Piedmont.},

  abstract = {Coupled respirometric and radiotracer techniques were applied to simultaneously measure the rates of oxygen and metal uptake in the green mussel Perna viridis. This was performed under different metabolic conditions by varying the ambient oxygen partial pressure (Po2), temperature, air exposure, and body size. When the mussels were tested under different hypoxic and anoxic conditions, Cd and Zn uptake decreased with decreasing Po2, accompanied by a decrease in the ventilation activity of mussels. Significant reduction in metal uptake was observed at a Po2 level of 3 kPa. Under anoxic conditions, the uptake of Cd and Zn was 1.6 to 2.7 times and 2.8 times, respectively, lower than those measured under normoxia. In contrast, both the absorption efficiencies of Cd and Zn and the oxygen extraction efficiency increased significantly with decreasing Po2. There were significant correlations between the rates of Cd/Zn and O2 uptake by the mussels when quantified under various Po2 levels. The uptake of Cd and Zn was temperature dependent and increased with temperature over a range of 15 to 30°C. Significant correlations between the rates of Cd/Zn and O2 uptake were also found in the temperature experiments. With reimmersion of mussels after aerial exposure, the mussels experienced an apparent O2 debt. Metal uptake also increased within the first 15 min followed by gradual recovery to the control levels. Similarly, the quantified uptake rates of Zn were significantly correlated with the O2 uptake in experiments with different sizes of mussels. These results strongly suggest that Cd and Zn uptake are coupled with oxygen uptake in the mussels; thus, physiological processes need to be considered in studying metal accumulation.},

  abstract = {Crayfish and their ectosymbiotic worms may be a valuable model system for studying strategies to maintain symbiotic relationships strained by host-induced environmental shifts. Ectosymbiotic branchiobdellidan worms are thought to be dependent on crayfish hosts for reproduction. However, many crayfish species leave surface waters to excavate and reside in subterranean burrows. During this semi-terrestrial phase, crayfish are frequently out of water, subjecting their associated worms to desiccation. Water balance characteristics of Cambarincola mesochoreus, an ectosymbiont of Procambarus clarkii, were examined to elucidate strategies for surviving emersion while maintaining host associations. Emersed worms were characterized by a high water loss rate and low tolerance for dehydration. A lack of direct water contact eventually prompted a coiled, immobile dormant state where water loss was temporarily suppressed. This dormant state was broken by addition of water and re-entered by subsequent emersion. Neither group effects by clustering of many worms, nor water vapor absorption were utilized as mechanisms to increase desiccation hardiness. When crayfish leave surface or subterranean water, worm survival while maintaining host contact is likely facilitated by facultative quiescence. However, this strategy only allows for survival during relatively short-term, cyclic bouts of emersion. Survival of longer-term emersion periods would require worms to leave hosts and remain behind in surface or subterranean water. These strategies likely incur counterbalancing trade-offs: increased mortality but maintenance of host association versus increased survival but temporary or permanent loss of host association and sites for reproduction.},

  abstract = {The physiological responses of marine bivalves to chronic cadmium (Cd) exposure at sub-lethal concentrations have been well documented. As of now, few studies have examined the effect of Cd exposure and subsequent recovery period at environmentally realistic concentrations. In this study, environmentally, Cd exposures were performed to assess the physiological responses of the Manila clam Ruditapes philippinarum. The clams were exposed to waterborne Cd at two environmentally realistic concentrations (4 and 40 μg L−1) for 35 days and then allowed to recover for another 35 days. The accumulation and elimination of Cd in R. philippinarum were tissue-specific and dose- and time-dependent. Cd accumulation increased sharply in the digestive gland, and Cd elimination was rapid in the gill. Major physiological responses, including clearance rate, absorption efficiency, respiration rate, excretion rate, oxygen to nitrogen ratio, and scope for growth, were significantly affected by Cd exposure. Yet, the clams exposed to 4-μg L−1 Cd were able to quickly recover their normal physiological processes and clearly exhibited catch-up growth once they were transferred to clean seawater. Hence, R. philippinarum can exhibit good physiological plasticity when confronted with moderately environmental Cd exposure. All physiological responses measured exhibited a highly significant and generally predictable correlation with tissue Cd concentration, which in turn, reflected environmentally realistic exposure conditions. Our results further confirm that the measurement of physiological responses is a sensitive method for assessing stress at environmentally realistic metal concentrations.},

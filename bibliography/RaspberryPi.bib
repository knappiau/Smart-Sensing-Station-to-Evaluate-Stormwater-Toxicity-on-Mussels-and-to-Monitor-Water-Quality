The INTER-MAGNET network has therefore specified quantitative criteria to ensure a high quality standard of geomagnetic observatories. Here, we present a new data acquisition system which was designed to meet these criteria, in particular with respect to 1 Hz data. This system is based on a Raspberry Pi embedded PC and runs a C++ data acquisition software. As a result, the data acquisition system is modular, cheap, and flexible, and it can be operated in remote areas with limited power supply. In addition, the system is capable of near-real-time data transmission, using a reverse SSH tunnel to work with any network available. The system hardware was successfully tested at the Niemegk observatory for a period of 1 year and subsequently installed at the Tatuoca observatory in Brazil.},

At the core of the project is the Astro Pi payload, which was developed to be taken to the ISS and into classrooms. It consists of a Raspberry Pi B+ computer, an add-on board called the Sense Hardware Attached on Top (HAT), a camera, a joystick, and six push buttons. The Sense HAT board was designed to host a range of sensors and input/output devices to be used for experiments aboard the ISS and in the classroom. The payload was qualified for spaceflight in 2015, and a competition was run to promote engagement between schools and the UK space industry that was supported by a range of learning resources. The payload was launched into space on the Orbital Sciences OA-4 Cygnus cargo freighter in December 2015, and the winning experiments were run on the ISS by Tim Peake in early 2016. These generated a range of data for analysis on the ground. Between February and March 2016, a second competition was run. In both competitions, the prize was to have students' code uploaded and run on the Astro Pi payload by Tim Peake. This paper is divided into four sections. The first provides details of the Cygnus launch and flight operations aboard the ISS. The second reviews the results of the first competition, and how these were distributed and analysed by the schools. The third covers the second competition including its results, impact, and engagement. The fourth details ongoing outreach, events, and the establishment of a long-term legacy for Astro Pi.

Several studies explain how to achieve an energy saving at home, and the use of smart thermostats will help to reduce energy consumption while increasing the efficiency of households. In this article, a comparative evaluation was carried out between four smart thermostats that are now on the market, whose characteristics vary in terms of price, precision of measurements and set temperature, algorithms, etc. A thermal test chamber was designed and constructed from a refrigerator, a thermal blanket, a Raspberry Pi and the necessary electronic components for its control and data collection. From the tests carried out in the thermal chamber, data on the operation of the four thermostats such as the maintenance and the anticipation of the setpoint temperature, were obtained. It was necessary to run the system enough times for each thermostat to memorize the housing characteristics, such as its inertia and its thermal insulation. This would also allow for the generation of a better algorithm to regulate the temperature, which would create a lower oscillation with respect to the setpoint temperature. The learning of the thermostats was not demonstrated and for the anticipation mode it was seen that the thermostats failed to improve or learn in this aspect, as they did not improve the start-up times of the heating system, with the consequent increase in energy consumption.},

	abstract = {Zebrafish animal models lend themselves to behavioral assays that can facilitate rapid screening of ototoxic, otoprotective, and otoregenerative drugs. Structurally similar to human inner ear hair cells, the mechanosensory hair cells on their lateral line allow the zebrafish to sense water flow and orient head-to-current in a behavior called rheotaxis. This rheotaxis behavior deteriorates in a dose-dependent manner with increased exposure to the ototoxin cisplatin, thereby establishing itself as an excellent biomarker for anatomic damage to lateral line hair cells. Building on work by our group and others, we have built a new, fully automated high-throughput behavioral assay system that uses automated image analysis techniques to quantify rheotaxis behavior. This novel system consists of a custom-designed swimming apparatus and imaging system consisting of network-controlled Raspberry Pi microcomputers capturing infrared video. Automated analysis techniques detect individual zebrafish, compute their orientation, and quantify the rheotaxis behavior of a zebrafish test population, producing a powerful, high-throughput behavioral assay. Using our fully automated biological assay to test a standardized ototoxic dose of cisplatin against varying doses of compounds that protect or regenerate hair cells may facilitate rapid translation of candidate drugs into preclinical mammalian models of hearing loss.},

	abstract = {Background: Operant training systems make use of water or food restriction and make it necessary to weigh animals to ensure compliance with experimental endpoints. In other applications periodic weighing is necessary to assess drug side-effects, or as an endpoint in feeding experiments. Periodic weighing while essential can disrupt animal circadian rhythms and social structure. New method: Automatic weighing system within paired mouse homecages. Up to 10 mice freely move between two cages (28 x 18 x 9 cm) which were connected by a weighing chamber mounted on a load cell. Each mouse was identified using an RFID tag placed under the skin of the neck. A single-board computer (Raspberry Pi; RPi) controls the task, logging RFID tag, load cell weights, and time stamps from each RFID detection until the animal leaves the chamber. Collected data were statistically analyzed to estimate mouse weights. We anticipate integration with tasks where automated imaging or behaviour is assessed in homecages. Results: Mice frequently move between the two cages, an average of 42+-16 times/day/mouse at which time we obtained weights. We report accurate determination of mouse weight and long term monitoring over 53 days. Comparison with existing methods Although commercial systems are available for automatically weighing rodents, they only work with single animals, or are not open source nor cost effective for specific custom application. Conclusions: This automated system permits automated weighing of mice 40 times per day. The system employs inexpensive hardware and open-source Python code. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

These effects can be reduced effectively by proper short-term cloud passing forecasting and suitable PV power plant output power control. This paper proposes a low-cost Internet of Things (IoT)-based solution for intra-minute cloud passing forecasting. The hardware consists of a Raspberry PI Model B 3 with a WiFi connection and an OmniVision OV5647 sensor with a mounted wide-angle lens, a circular polarizing (CPL) filter and a natural density (ND) filter. The completely new algorithm for cloud passing forecasting uses the green and blue colors in the photo to determine the position of the Sun, to recognize the clouds, and to predict their movement. The image processing is performed in several stages, considering selectively only a small part of the photo relevant to the movement of the clouds in the vicinity of the Sun in the next minute. The proposed algorithm is compact, fast and suitable for implementation on low cost processors with low computation power. The speed of the cloud parts closest to the Sun is used to predict when the clouds will cover the Sun. WiFi communication is used to transmit this data to the PV power plant control system in order to decrease the output power slowly and smoothly.},

	abstract = {The objective of this research work is to propose a weed detecting robotic model for sugarcane fields that uses a fuzzy real time classifier on leaf textures. The differentiation between weed and crop and weed removal are the two challenging tasks for the farmers especially in the Indian sugarcane cultivation scenario. The automatic weed detection and removal becomes a vital task for improving the cost effectiveness and efficiency of the agricultural processes. The detection of weeds by the robotic model employs a Raspberry Pi based control system placed in a moving vehicle. An automated image classification system has been designed which extracts leaf textures and employs a fuzzy real-time classification technique. Morphological operators are applied to extract circular leaf patterns in different scales from the leaf images. An optimal set of features have been identified for the characterization of crops and weeds in sugarcane fields. A weed detecting robotic prototype is designed and developed using a Raspberry Pi micro controller and suitable input output subsystems such as cameras, small light sources and motors with power systems. The prototype's control incorporates the weed detection mechanism using a Raspbian operating system support and python programming. The designed robotic prototype correctly identifies the sugarcane crop among nine different weed species. The system detects weeds with 92.9\% accuracy over a processing time of 0.02 s.

Users of these units are, however, often frustrated by the limited options for controlling camera functions, the generation of large numbers of images, and the lack of flexibility to suit different research environments and questions. We describe the development of a user-customisable open source camera trap platform named 'WiseEye', designed to provide flexible camera trap technology for wildlife researchers. The novel platform is based on a Raspberry Pi single-board computer and compatible peripherals that allow the user to control its functions and performance. We introduce the concept of confirmatory sensing, in which the Passive Infrared triggering is confirmed through other modalities (i.e. radar, pixel change) to reduce the occurrence of false positives images. This concept, together with user-definable meta-data, aided identification of spurious images and greatly reduced post-collection processing time. When tested against a commercial camera trap, WiseEye was found to reduce the incidence of false positive images and false negatives across a range of test conditions. WiseEye represents a step-change in camera trap functionality, greatly increasing the value of this technology for wildlife research and conservation management.},

The image sensor used is a red green blue - infrared (RGB-IR) micro-camera controlled by a Raspberry Pi board where a basic image processing algorithm has been programmed. It allows the visualization in an integrated display of the reflectance and the histogram of the images at each wavelength, including UV and NIRs. Findings The prototype has been tested by analyzing several samples in a variety of applications such as detection of damaged, over-ripe and sprayed fruit, classification of different type of plastic materials and determination of properties of water.

Students were required to build their own visible spectrometer using interlocking building bricks with simple optical elements and a Raspberry Pi computer. Experiments were then conducted to explore the instrumental capabilities while, at the same time, using Python programming to plot data, perform linear least-squares fitting, and calculate errors. Instrument response and spectral measurements were followed by kinetic studies, enabling the students to tackle a "real" problem by extracting rate constants. The main learning outcomes were that the students would gain a better understanding of instrumental components and at the same time learn valuable analytical techniques such as calibration, determination of the limits of linearity, and dynamic range.

Often the data require real-time processing to support high system responsiveness which can be supported by localised Cloud and/or Fog computing paradigms. However, there are considerably large deployments of IoT such as sensor networks in remote areas where Internet connectivity is sparse, challenging the localised Cloud and/or Fog computing paradigms. With the advent of the Raspberry Pi, a credit card-sized single board computer, there is a great opportunity to construct low-cost, low-power portable cloud to support real-time data processing next to IoT deployments. In this paper, we extend our previous work on constructing Raspberry Pi Cloud to study its feasibility for real-time big data analytics under realistic application-level workload in both native and virtualised environments. We have extensively tested the performance of a single node Raspberry Pi 2 Model B with httperf and a cluster of 12 nodes with Apache Spark and HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System). Our results have demonstrated that our portable cloud is useful for supporting real-time big data analytics. On the other hand, our results have also unveiled that overhead for CPU-bound workload in virtualised environment is surprisingly high, at 67.2\%. We have found that, for big data applications, the virtualisation overhead is fractional for small jobs but becomes more significant for large jobs, up to 28.6\%.},

	abstract = {An inexpensive platform has been developed for automated measurements of air quality. Low-cost sensors for aerosol optical thickness, ozone, temperature, relative humidity, and pressure were combined with a low-cost computer (Raspberry Pi) for automated monitoring. The Raspberry Pi is well-suited to automated measurements because of: (1) its low cost, (2) its low power consumption, (3) its ability to communicate over Ethernet or wireless networks and (4) its ability to interface with many sensors through analog-to-digital converters or directly through Universal Serial Bus (USB), serial port, Inter-Integrated Circuit ((IC)-C-2), and Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI). This setup is appropriate for use in, e.g., undergraduate atmospheric research groups, where the cost of typical automated sensors is prohibitively expensive. We report measurements taken over a two-month period which includes evidence of high nighttime ozone due to being downwind of a forest fire. This platform can be expanded to enable other atmospheric measurements from a number of sensors.},

Their proper functioning is therefore essential to ensure reliable and repeatable experimental results. Despite this fact, in many academic laboratories little attention is paid to validating and monitoring their function, primarily due to the cost and/or technical complexity of available commercial solutions. We have therefore developed a simple and low-cost monitoring system that combines a "Raspberry Pi" single-board computer with USB-connected sensor interfaces to track and log parameters such as temperature and pressure, and send email alert messages as appropriate. The system is controlled by open-source software, and we have also generated scripts to automate software setup so that no background in programming is required to install and use it. We have applied it to investigate the behaviour of our own equipment, and present here the results along with the details of the monitoring system used to obtain them.},

However, the existing widely used architecture of wireless sensor networks for rain monitoring relies on network transportation and back-end calculation, which causes delay in response to heavy rain in localized areas. Our work improves the architecture by applying logistic regression and support vector machine classification to an intelligent wireless sensor node which is created by Raspberry Pi. The sensor nodes in front-end not only obtain data from sensors, but also can analyze the probabilities of upcoming heavy rain independently and give early warnings to local clients in time. When the sensor nodes send the probability to back-end server, the burdens of network transport are released. We demonstrate by simulation results that our sensor system architecture has potentiality to increase the local response to heavy rain. The monitoring capacity is also raised.},

	abstract = {Noise pollution caused by vehicular traffic is a common problem in urban environments that has been shown to affect people's health and children's cognition. In the last decade, several studies have been conducted to assess this noise, by measuring the equivalent noise pressure level (called L-eq) to acquire an accurate sound map using wireless networks with acoustic sensors. However, even with similar values of L-eq, people can feel the noise differently according to its frequency characteristics. Thus, indexes, which can express people's feelings by subjective measures, are required. In this paper, we analyze the suitability of using the psychoacoustic metrics given by the Zwicker's model, instead of just only considering L-eq. The goal is to evaluate the hardware limitations of a low-cost wireless acoustic sensor network that is used to measure the annoyance, using two types of commercial and off-the-shelf sensor nodes, Tmote-Invent nodes and Raspberry Pi platforms. Moreover, to calculate the parameters using these platforms, different simplifications to the Zwicker's model based on the specific features of road traffic noise are proposed. To validate the different alternatives, the aforementioned nodes are tested in a traffic congested area of Valencia City in a vertical and horizontal network deployment. Based on the results, it is observed that the Raspberry Pi platforms are a feasible low-cost alternative to increase the spatial-temporal resolution, whereas Tmote-Invent nodes do not confirm their suitability due to their limited memory and calibration issues.},

	abstract = {Smart water distribution networks are a good example of a large scale Cyber-Physical System that requires monitoring for precise data analysis and network control. Due to the critical nature of water distribution, an extensive simulation of decision making and control algorithms are required before their deployment. Although some aspects of water network behaviour can be simulated in software such as hydraulic responses in valve changes, software simulators are unable to include dynamic events such as leakages or bursts in physical models. Furthermore, due to safety concerns, contemporary large-scale testbeds are limited to the monitoring processes or control methods with well established safety guarantees. Sophisticated algorithms for dynamic and optimal water network reconfiguration are not yet widespread. This paper presents a small-scale testbed, WaterBox, which allows the simulation of emerging/advanced monitoring and control algorithms in a fail-safe environment. The flexible hydraulic, hardware, and software infrastructure enables a substantial number of experiments. On-going experiments are related to in-node data processing and decision making, energy optimization, event-driven communication, and automatic control.},

It consists of a multi-wavelength light source with two photodiode detectors capable of measuring the transmission and side-scattering of the light in the detector head. This enables the sensor to give qualitative data on the changes in the optical opacity of the water. Laboratory tests to confirm colour and turbidity-related responses are described and the results given. The autonomous sensor underwent field deployments in an estuarine environment, and the results presented here show the sensors capacity to detect changes in opacity and colour relating to potential pollution events. The application of this low-cost optical sensor is in the area of environmental pollution alerts to support a water monitoring programme, where multiple such sensors could be deployed as part of a network.},

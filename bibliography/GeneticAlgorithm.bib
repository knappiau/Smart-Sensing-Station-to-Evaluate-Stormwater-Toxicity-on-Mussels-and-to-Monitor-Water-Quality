	abstract = {Prompt detection of intentional or accidental contamination of the public water supply is vital to maintain public health in any centralized water distribution system. Being able to quickly detect a system contamination event may be the single most influential factor to reduce possible contamination fallout. Consequently, major research has explored how to best protect a water distribution system (WDS) through strategic placement of fixed water quality monitoring stations. Although fixed monitoring stations within a wireless sensor network (WSN) are robust with respect to hydraulic conditions, the stations are expensive to place, and may not provide the highest spatial and temporal resolution of contamination detection. This work sets to build the understanding of a mobile wireless sensor network (MWSN) where inline mobile sensors function within water in pipes to monitor water quality and to wirelessly transmit data to fixed transceivers in real time. Mobile sensor behavior was modeled alongside contamination simulations and the deployment of fixed and mobile sensors was together optimized to minimize the affected population prior contamination event detection constrained by a total system cost. Results show a MWSN to be highly sensitive to sensor battery life, transceiver network coverage, and total system cost. Future obstacles for implementation of a MWSN are highlighted and discussed to be address in future work. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

	abstract = {A new sensor placement problem is formulated to cover two objectives of: (1) assuring quality of water delivered to consumers; and (2) detection of any contamination event at the earliest so as to minimize its consequences, through maximization of: (1) demand coverage; and (2) time-constrained detection likelihood for pressure deficient networks. The network may become pressure-deficient owing to continued use of water distribution network beyond its design life. The two objectives are combined using weights. Genetic algorithm is used to obtain optimum sensor locations. The methodology is applied to a pressure-deficient network in the Dharampeth zone of Nagpur city (India). The pressure-dependent analysis is carried out using WaterGem v8i to simulate the system hydraulics. Performance objectives are evaluated considering the availability of flows at nodes and velocity of flow in pipes under pressure-deficient conditions. Comparison of optimal sensor network design is carried out with that obtained by demand-dependent analysis.},

By placing the sensors for real-time monitoring of water quality in urban water supply, it can greatly reduce the probability of incidents of contamination. But how to use the information collected by water quality sensors to identify the contaminant source is a challenging problem. In this paper, we formulated the contaminant source identification problem into an optimization problem, and used hybrid encoding method to code the problem according to the properties of a variable, so as to improve the convergence speed and accuracy. We used different size of pipe network data in experiment, which results finally verified the validity and robustness of the proposed method.},

	abstract = {In this study, optimal water quality sensor placement is performed based on the sensitivity of flow direction under different water demands for detecting accidental water quality contamination. First, Betweenness Centrality (BC), a network analysis method, is used for determining optimal locations considering a network's connectivity. Second, sensor locations are optimized for minimizing the contaminant intrusion detection time using the travel time matrix and the Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA). These methods were applied to two water distribution networks. It was found that the BC method generates optimal locations close to the water sources and the water main, whereas the MOGA-based method generates optimal sensor locations far away from the sources. These results support the following conclusions. First, the installation priority of gauges can be determined with a more objective standard using the aforementioned two methods. Second, given specific objectives, the two models can be used as alternative decision-making tools for sensor installation.},

	abstract = {Placement of water quality sensors in a water distribution system is a common approach for minimizing contamination intrusion risks. This study incorporates detailed chemistry of organophosphate contaminations into the problem of sensor placement and links quantitative measures of the affected population as a result of such intrusions. The suggested methodology utilizes the stoichiometry and kinetics of the reactions between organophosphate contaminants and free chlorine for predicting the number of affected consumers. This is accomplished through linking a multi-species water quality model and a statistical dose response model. Three organophosphates (chlorpyrifos, malathion, and parathion) are tested as possible contaminants. Their corresponding by-products were modeled and accounted for in the affected consumers impact calculations. The methodology incorporates a series of randomly generated intrusion events linked to a genetic algorithm for minimizing the contaminants impact through a sensors system. Three example applications are explored for demonstrating the model capabilities through base runs and sensitivity analyses. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This paper proposes a detection method using multiple conventional water quality sensors and introduces a method to determine the values of parameters, which was configured as a multiple optimization problem and solved using a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II). The capability of the proposed method to detect contamination events caused by cadmium nitrate is demonstrated in this paper. The performance of the proposed method to detect events caused by different concentrations was also investigated. Results show that, after calibration, the proposed method can detect a contamination event 1 min after addition of cadmium nitrate at the concentration of 0.008 mg/l and has low false negative and positive rates.},

	abstract = {Eagle Creek, Morse and Geist reservoirs, drinking water supply sources for the Indianapolis, Indiana, USA metropolitan region, are experiencing nuisance cyanobacterial blooms. Hyperspectral remote sensing has been proven to be an effective tool for phycocyanin (C-PC) concentration retrieval, a proxy pigment unique to cyanobacteria in freshwater ecosystems. An adaptive model based on genetic algorithm and partial least squares (GA-PLS), together with three-band algorithm (TBA) and other band ratio algorithms were applied to hyperspectral data acquired from in situ (ASD spectrometer) and airborne (AISA sensor) platforms. The results indicated that GA-PLS achieved high correlation between measured and estimated C-PC for GR (RMSE=16.3 mu g/L, RMSE\%=18.2; range (R): 2.6-185.1 mu g/L), MR (RMSE=8.7 mu g/L, RMSE\%=15.6; R: 3.3-371.0 mu g/L) and ECR (RMSE=19.3 mu g/L, RMSE\%=26.4; R: 0.7-245.0 mu g/L) for the in situ datasets. TBA also performed well compared to other band ratio algorithms due to its optimal band tuning process and the reduction of backscattering effects through the third band. GA-PLS (GR: RMSE=24.1 mu g/L, RMSE\%=25.2, R: 25.2-185.1 mu g/L; MR: RMSE=15.7 mu g/L, RMSE\%=37.4, R: 2.0-135.1 mu g/L) and TBA (GR: RMSE=28.3 mu g/L, RMSE\%=30.1; MR: RMSE=17.7 mu g/L, RMSE\%=41.9) methods results in somewhat lower accuracy using AISA imagery data, which is likely due to atmospheric correction or radiometric resolution. GA-PLS (TBA) obtained an RMSE of 24.82 mu g/L (35.8 mu g/L), and RMSE\% of 31.24 (43.5) between measured and estimated C-PC for aggregated datasets. C-PC maps were generated through GA-PLS using AISA imagery data. The C-PC concentration had an average value of 67.31 +/- 44.23 mu g/L in MR with a large range of concentration, while the GR had a higher average value 103.17 +/- 33.45 mu g/L.

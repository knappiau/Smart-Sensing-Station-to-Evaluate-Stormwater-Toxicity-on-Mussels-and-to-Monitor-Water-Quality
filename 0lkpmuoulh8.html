<div>In  contrast, lethal and sublethal effects decreased or were un-detectible after  the stormwater was treated by flushing through a bioretention cell: Using a bioretention  soil medium that was composed of 60% sand, 15% compost, 15% shredded bark, and  10% drinking water treatment residuals by volume, the bioretention treatment  dramatically improved stormwater quality and reversed nearly all forms of  developmental toxicity&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite rendered v1 not-editable" data-raw-citation="\citep{mcintyre_zebrafish_2014}"><a href="#mcintyre_zebrafish_2014">(McIntyre et al., 2014)</a></cite>.

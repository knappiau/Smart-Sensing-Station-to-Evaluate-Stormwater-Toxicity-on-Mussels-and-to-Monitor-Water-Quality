<div>In  contrast, lethal and sublethal effects decreased or were un-detectible after  the stormwater was treated by flushing through a bioretention cell: Using a bioretention  soil medium that was composed of 60% sand, 15% compost, 15% shredded bark, and  10% drinking water treatment residuals by volume, the bioretention treatment  dramatically improved stormwater quality and reversed nearly all forms of  developmental toxicity&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite rendered v1 not-editable" data-raw-citation="\citep{mcintyre_zebrafish_2014}"><a href="#mcintyre_zebrafish_2014">(McIntyre et al., 2014)</a></cite>.

Bioretention cells, a LID stormwater control measure, have been  implemented in a small number of Alabama communities. Bioretention cells are  constructed depressions in the  landscape that capture and store stormwater for less than 48 hours (Fig. <span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{905724}</span>). The components include an underlying  specialized soil media that is specific to individual regions or states. In  Alabama, the recommended soil media is 85-88% sand, 8-12 % fines, and 3-5%  organic matter&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{dylewski_lid_2014}</cite>&nbsp;. Recommended bioretention media in other states range in sand content from 30-90% with silts, clays, organic matter, and compost being the other constituents.</div><div></div>

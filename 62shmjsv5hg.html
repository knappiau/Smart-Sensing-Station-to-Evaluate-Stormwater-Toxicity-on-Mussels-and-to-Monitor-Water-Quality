<div>Biological early warning systems (BEWSs) provide behavioral and  physiological response alerts when contaminants pulse down waterways in concentrations  that are likely to have negative effects on aquatic communities&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{bae2014biological}</cite>. Behavioral responses of bivalves can serve as a valuable early warning  system. Mussels must keep their shells open to obtain food and oxygen from the  surrounding waters. However, they respond to toxicants and close their shells.  Electromagnetic sensors attached to each valve are used to monitor gaping and  closing behavior and set off alarms when behavior indicates the presence of  stressful toxicants in the water&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{manley_behavioural_1979,kramer_valve_1989,gnyubkin_early_2009}</cite>. Systems such as the Mosselmonitor (<a href="http://www.mosselmonitor.nl" target="_blank">www.mosselmonitor.nl</a>; <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citealt{kramer_valve_1989}</cite> ) and the Dreissena Monitor (Envicontrol KÃ¶ln Germany; <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citealt{borcherding_dreissena-monitor_1994}</cite>) have been used to monitor fresh and saltwater environments  in Europe.</div>

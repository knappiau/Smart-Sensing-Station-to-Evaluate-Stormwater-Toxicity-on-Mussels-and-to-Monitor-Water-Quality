<div></div><h2 data-label="608783" class="ltx_title_subsection">Stormwater Treatment with Bioretention Media</h2><div>Low impact development (LID), or green stormwater  infrastructure, involves innovative stormwater management that treats the  first, most polluted, flush of stormwater before it reaches a stream, river, or  lake. Bioretention cells, a LID stormwater control measure, have been  implemented in a small number of Alabama communities. Bioretention cells are  constructed depressions in the  landscape that capture and store stormwater for less than 48 hours (Fig. <span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{905724}</span>). The components include an underlying  specialized soil media that is specific to individual regions or states. In  Alabama, the recommended soil media is 85-88% sand, 8-12 % fines, and 3-5%  organic matter&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{dylewski_lid_2014}</cite>&nbsp;. Recommended bioretention media in other states range in sand content from 30-90% with silts, clays, organic matter, and compost being the other constituents.</div><div></div>

<h2 data-label="161369" class="ltx_title_subsection"></h2><h2 data-label="161369" class="ltx_title_subsection">Objective 3:&nbsp;Implement a smart sensing station in a local watershed</h2><div>To meat our objectives we will build a Smart Sensing Station that will host mussels and different sensors, such as toxicity sensors (to be developed in this project), and of the shelf sensors (i.e., water depth, temperature, and turbidity). A first prototype of the smart sensing station will be connected to a stormwater flume on the campus of Auburn University (Fig.&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{894273}</span>). Stormwater from this flume was found to be toxic to&nbsp;<i>Daphnia pulex,&nbsp;</i>if untreated&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Kuntz:2017}</cite>. The stormwater flow will be separated and one half will be treated with the Alabama bioretention mix and the other half will remain untreated. Both flows, treated and untreated, will then be routed in separate mussel containing chambers (Symbols A and B in Fig.&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{894273}</span>). Stream water will be directed to a third chamber&nbsp;(Symbol C in Fig.&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{894273}</span>) to monitor mussel behavior when exposed to stream water only and to capture eventual contaminant plumes that are in the stream already. During dry periods, stream water will be directed to all 3 chambers (A-C) to sustain the mussels.</div><div>We will construct three mussel BEWS based on the published design of commercially available Musselmonitors (AquaDect, Netherlands), and populate them with <i>Lampsilis straminea</i>, a mussel commonly found in Alabama streams and currently grown by James Stoeckel in mussel "farming" ponds at the Alabama Agricultural Experimental Station. These ponds are isolated from stormwater runoff and other contaminant sources and used to supply mussels for research. Each mussel will be fitted with high frequency electromagnetic induction sensors attached to the shells of the mussels to monitor gaping behavior. Gaping behavior patterns are monitored using computer software (e.g. Presentit2) that analyzes for departure from "normal" patterns (e.g. closure, reduced opening, gaping). When abnormal patterns are detected, an alarm specific to that behavior is set off and the user is alerted.</div>

A first prototype of the smart sensing station will be connected to a stormwater flume on the campus of Auburn University (Fig.&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{894273}</span>). Stormwater from this flume was found to be toxic to&nbsp;<i>Daphnia pulex,&nbsp;</i>if untreated&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Kuntz:2017}</cite>. The stormwater flow will be separated and one half will be treated with the Alabama bioretention mix and the other half will remain untreated. Both flows, treated and untreated, will then be routed in separate mussel containing chambers (Symbols A and B in Fig.&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{894273}</span>). Stream water will be directed to a third chamber&nbsp;(Symbol C in Fig.&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{894273}</span>) to monitor mussel behavior when exposed to stream water only and to capture eventual contaminant plumes that are in the stream already. During dry periods, stream water will be directed to all 3 chambers (A-C) to sustain the mussels.</div><div></div><h2>Biological Early Warning Systems</h2>

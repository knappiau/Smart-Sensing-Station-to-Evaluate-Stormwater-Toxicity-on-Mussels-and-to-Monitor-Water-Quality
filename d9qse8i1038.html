<h2 data-label="161369" class="ltx_title_subsection"></h2><h2 data-label="161369" class="ltx_title_subsection">Objective 3:&nbsp;Implement a smart sensing station in a local watershed</h2><div>To meat our objectives we will build a Smart Sensing Station that will host mussels and different sensors, such as toxicity sensors (to be developed in this project), and of the shelf sensors (i.e., water depth, temperature, and turbidity). A first prototype of the smart sensing station will be connected to a stormwater flume on the campus of Auburn University (Fig.&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{894273}</span>). Stormwater from this flume was found to be toxic to&nbsp;<i>Daphnia pulex,&nbsp;</i>if untreated&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Kuntz:2017}</cite>. The stormwater flow will be separated and one half will be treated with the Alabama bioretention mix and the other half will remain untreated. Both flows, treated and untreated, will then be routed in separate mussel containing chambers (Symbols A and B in Fig.&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{894273}</span>). Stream water will be directed to a third chamber&nbsp;(Symbol C in Fig.&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{894273}</span>) to monitor mussel behavior when exposed to stream water only and to capture eventual contaminant plumes that are in the stream already. During dry periods, stream water will be directed to all 3 chambers (A-C) to sustain the mussels.</div><div><b>Embedded computer system:&nbsp;</b>We will use Raspberry Pis as frameworks for our sensor system (<a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org" target="_blank">www.raspberrypi.org</a>). Raspberry Pis are economical, yet powerful and affordable micro computer systems. Recently, Raspberry Pis have been used in geosciences&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{moure_use_2015,morschhauser_low-power_2017}</cite>, automation&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{noorshams_automating_2017,todd_fully_2017}</cite>, image analysis&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{lopez-ruiz_portable_2017}</cite>, signal processing&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{pasolini_raspberry_2017}</cite>, forecasting&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{sukic_intra-minute_2017,richardson_low_2017}</cite>, as well as environmental and water quality monitoring .</div><div>Using a Raspberry Pi has many advantages over other computer or micro controller systems: They run a linux based operating system which makes it easy to implement the sensor algorithms (which were developed in objective 2) including specific R or python packages. Another advantage of the linux based operating system is that it is easy to implement a web server which means it would be possible to access the stations data directly through an internet browser. Raspberry Pis are equipped with basic I/O architecture like flash card reader, ethernet, USB, etc which lowers development costs. A powerful CPU and more RAM allow us to perform high performance computations directly on the smart sensing station.&nbsp;</div>

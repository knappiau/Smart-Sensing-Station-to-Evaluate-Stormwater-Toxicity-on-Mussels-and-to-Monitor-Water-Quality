G can be inverted to obtain the parallel resistance value, and B can be divided by the radian frequency to obtain a parallel capacitance. By performing a frequency sweep using the network analyzer, plots of resistance and capacitance versus frequency can be obtained. &nbsp; Fig. <span class="au-ref-link not-editable"><a href="#author-label-267818">5</a></span>A shows the capacitance of different liquids, such as stormwater, tap water, DI water, and water containing different forms of nitrogen. In a preliminary test, we added copper and zinc at concentrations similar to those found in stormwater leading to different results in the capacitance curve (Fig. <span class="au-ref-link not-editable"><a href="#author-label-267818">5</a></span>B). These results indicate, that it is possible to sense typical stormwater contaminants with this proposed sensor.</div>

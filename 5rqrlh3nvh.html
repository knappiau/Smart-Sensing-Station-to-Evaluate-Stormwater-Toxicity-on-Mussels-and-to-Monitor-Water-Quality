<div>Water is one of the most studied compounds. It is a polar molecule with an electrical resistivity of approximately 18.18 MΩ-cm at 25C&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite rendered v1 not-editable" data-raw-citation="\citep{Light_2005}"><a href="#Light_2005">(Light et al., 2005)</a></cite>, and a relative permittivity of approximately 78.3 at 25C&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite rendered v1 not-editable" data-raw-citation="\citep{Schwan_1976}"><a href="#Schwan_1976">(Schwan et al., 1976)</a></cite>. The electrical properties of water are temperature dependent&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite rendered v1 not-editable" data-raw-citation="\citep{Malmberg_1956}"><a href="#Malmberg_1956">(Malmberg et al., 1956)</a></cite>. When an ionic compound dissolves in water, the ions become mobile charge carriers, which results in a decrease in the low frequency electrical resistivity of the aqueous solution, since ions move much slower in a solution than electrons move in a solid conductor. Additionally, dissolved ions, such as the nitrate ion, form physically large and concentration dependent hydration shells with water molecules. Due to their large size, these hydration shells possess a relatively low mechanical resonant frequency, which can be excited into vibration by applying RF energy at relatively low frequencies, on the order of tens of MHz&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite rendered v1 not-editable" data-raw-citation="\citep{Chighladze_2010}"><a href="#Chighladze_2010">(Chighladze et al., 2010)</a></cite>. This electromechanical phenomenon, known as relaxation, results in a frequency dependent complex permittivity. Other compounds, with much lower dielectric constants than water, can mix with water to alter the dielectric constant of the resulting aqueous solution. These effects cause the sensor’s impedance to be a function of both the chemistry of the solution and the excitation frequency at which the sensor’s impedance is measured.</div>

<div>Water is one of the most studied compounds. It is a polar molecule with an electrical resistivity of approximately 18.18 MÎ©-cm at 25C&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Light_2005}</cite>, and a relative permittivity of approximately 78.3 at 25C&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Schwan_1976}</cite>. The electrical properties of water are temperature dependent&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Malmberg_1956}</cite>. When an ionic compound dissolves in water, the ions become mobile charge carriers, which results in a decrease in the low frequency electrical resistivity of the aqueous solution, since ions move much slower in a solution than electrons m</div>

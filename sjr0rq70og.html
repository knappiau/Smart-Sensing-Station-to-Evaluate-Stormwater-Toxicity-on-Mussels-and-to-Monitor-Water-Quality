<div><b>Sublethal effects:&nbsp;</b>Stormwater contaminants may not always cause mortality within 48 hours, but may still stress or harm aquatic organisms - resulting in sublethal effects. Respirometry is one accepted method to determine sublethal effects&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{chen_comparison_2001,mueller_regulation_2011}</cite>. Stormwater contaminants, including nitrogen compounds and metals, affect oxygen consumption patterns of mussels&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{wang_metal_2005,zhao_environmental_2014}</cite>. These patterns reflect various physiological functions andcharacteristics, including respiration rate, ability to obtain sufficient oxygen under changing conditions, and hypoxia tolerance. Following standard closed respirometry protocols (e.g.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citealp{chen_comparison_2001,mueller_regulation_2011}</cite>), mussels and crayfish will be starved for 24 hours and then transferred to individual respirometry chambers (four channel, fiber optic respirometry system; Loligo Inc.). Following a 12-hour acclimation period, flow through each chamber will be shut off and respiration rate will be calculated every 3-6 minutes until dissolved oxygen (DO) declines to &lt; 1 mg/L. Data will be analyzed following the methodology of&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{mueller_regulation_2011}</cite>&nbsp; to determine respiration rates, ability to regulate oxygen consumption (RI: a measure of the ability of organisms to maintain a constant respiration rate), and critical dissolved oxygen concentration (DOcrit: a measure of the dissolved oxygen threshold below which severe stress and ultimately death is expected). Results will show whether untreated stormwater exhibited sublethal toxicity and whether bioretention soils were able to reduce or eliminate sublethal toxicity.</div><div><b>Relationship of mussel gaping behavior and toxicity sensor output:&nbsp;</b>The output from the toxicity sensor will be a frequency sweep of capacitance. We will test different methods to relate the sensor signal to mussel gaping behavior.</div><ol><li><i>Partial least square regression.</i> This method has been used before to relate water quality data to spectrophotometry&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Etheridge_2014,singh2011support}</cite> and in sensor development <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Liu_2010,Yu_2012,Kaneko_2011}</cite>. We think this method is suitable because partial least square is a method especially for spectral data link the data outputted by our sensor (Fig.&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{267818}</span>).</li><li><i>Non-linear least squares. </i>This method was developed to solve non-linear problems&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{levenberg1944method}</cite> and has been used in groundwater monitoring&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Yeh_1986}</cite>, water quality monitoring&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Tan_2012,Wagner_1987,moriasi2012hydrologic}</cite>, and sensor development&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{hansen2013least}</cite>. We will implement non-linear least square methods in case we observe non-linear relationships between the mussel gaping behavior and the toxicity sensor output that cannot be improved by square-root or logarithmic transformations.</li><li><i>Genetic Algorithms.&nbsp;</i>Genetic principles such as mutation and inheritance are used for data optimization&nbsp;</li><li><i>Machine learning.</i>&nbsp; Machine learning is based on algorithms that can learn from data without rules-based programming. This technique is suitable to find patterns in the sensor signal that fit to the mussel gaping behavior.&nbsp;</li></ol><div><b>Expected Outcome:</b> bla bla bla</div>

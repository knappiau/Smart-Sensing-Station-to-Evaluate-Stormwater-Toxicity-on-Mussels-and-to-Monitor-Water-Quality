<div><b>Sublethal effects:&nbsp;</b>Stormwater contaminants may not always cause mortality within 48 hours, but may still stress or harm aquatic organisms - resulting in sublethal effects. Respirometry is one accepted method to determine sublethal effects&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite rendered v1 not-editable" data-raw-citation="\citep{chen_comparison_2001,mueller_regulation_2011}"><a href="#chen_comparison_2001">(Chen et al., 2001;</a> <a href="#mueller_regulation_2011">Mueller et al., 2011)</a></cite>.

These patterns reflect various physiological functions andcharacteristics, including respiration rate, ability to obtain sufficient oxygen under changing conditions, and hypoxia tolerance. Following standard closed respirometry protocols (e.g.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite rendered v1 not-editable" data-raw-citation="\citealp{chen_comparison_2001,mueller_regulation_2011}"><a href="#chen_comparison_2001">Chen et al., 2001;</a> <a href="#mueller_regulation_2011">Mueller et al., 2011</a></cite>), mussels and crayfish will be starved for 24 hours and then transferred to individual respirometry chambers (four channel, fiber optic respirometry system; Loligo Inc.). Following a 12-hour acclimation period, flow through each chamber will be shut off and respiration rate will be calculated every 3-6 minutes until dissolved oxygen (DO) declines to &lt; 1 mg/L. Data will be analyzed following the methodology of&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite rendered v1 not-editable" data-raw-citation="\citet{mueller_regulation_2011}"><a href="#mueller_regulation_2011">Mueller et al. (2011)</a></cite>&nbsp; to determine respiration rates, ability to regulate oxygen consumption (RI: a measure of the ability of organisms to maintain a constant respiration rate), and critical dissolved oxygen concentration (DOcrit: a measure of the dissolved oxygen threshold below which severe stress and ultimately death is expected). Results will show whether untreated stormwater exhibited sublethal toxicity and whether bioretention soils were able to reduce or eliminate sublethal toxicity.
